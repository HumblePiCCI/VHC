# Sprint 3: The Agora - Communication (Implementation Plan)

**Context:** `System_Architecture.md` v0.2.0 (Sprint 3: The "Agora" - Communication)
**Goal:** Implement the "Agora" – the civic dialogue layer. This consists of **HERMES Messaging** (secure, private communication) and **HERMES Forum** (threaded civic discourse).
**Status:** [x] ✅ **COMPLETE** — All tests passing (Dec 3, 2025)

---

## 1. Guiding Constraints & Quality Gates

### 1.1 Non-Negotiables (Engineering Discipline)
- [x] **LOC Cap:** Hard limit of **350 lines** per file (tests/types exempt).
- [x] **Coverage:** **100%** Line/Branch coverage for new/modified modules.
- [x] **Browser-Safe:** No `node:*` imports in client code.
- [x] **Security:** E2EE (End-to-End Encryption) for all private messages.
- [x] **Privacy:** No metadata leakage; "First-to-File" principles apply to public civic data.

### 1.2 True Offline Mode (E2E Compatibility)
- [x] **True Offline Mode:** Messaging and Forum flows must run with `VITE_E2E_MODE=true` using full mocks (no WebSocket, no WebLLM, no real Gun relay), per `ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md`. E2E tests must assert that no network connections are attempted.

### 1.3 Gun Isolation & Topology
- [x] **Gun Isolation:** All access to Gun goes through `@vh/gun-client`. No direct `gun` imports in `apps/*` or other packages. The Hydration Barrier (`waitForRemote`) must be respected for all read/write operations.
- [x] **TopologyGuard Update:** Extend TopologyGuard allowed prefixes to include:
    - `~*/hermes/inbox/**`
    - `~*/hermes/outbox/**`
    - `~*/hermes/chats/**`
    - `vh/forum/threads/**`
    - `vh/forum/indexes/**`
    - Add unit tests asserting invalid paths are rejected.
    - Ensure Gun adapters for HERMES and Forum go through the guarded namespaces, not via raw mesh.

### 1.4 Identity & Trust Gating
- [x] **Trust Gating (Forum):** Creating threads/comments and voting in HERMES Forum requires `TrustScore >= 0.5` on the current session, aligned with `System_Architecture.md` §4.1.5 and `spec-hermes-forum-v0.md`.
- [x] **Session Requirement (Messaging):** HERMES Messaging requires an active session and identity (nullifier). Messaging adds no additional trustScore threshold beyond the session gate defined in `System_Architecture.md` §4.1.5.

### 1.5 XP & Privacy
- [x] **XP & Privacy:** Any XP accrual from Messaging/Forum must write only to the on-device XP ledger (`civicXP` / `socialXP` in `spec-xp-ledger-v0.md`), never emitting `{district_hash, nullifier, XP}` off-device.

### 1.6 HERMES vs AGORA Naming
- [x] **Navigation Model:**
    - **HERMES** = Communications layer: Messaging (DMs) + Forum (public civic discourse).
    - **AGORA** = Governance & projects (Sprint 4+): Collaborative documents, project/policy development, decision-making.
- [x] **Routing:**
    - HERMES tab → `/hermes` → surfaces both Messaging and Forum.
    - AGORA tab → `/governance` (or `/agora`) → governance/proposals (Sprint 4+).
- [x] **Elevation Path (Future):** Forum threads can be elevated into AGORA projects based on engagement, upvotes, and tags. *Deferred to Sprint 4.*

---

## 2. Phase 1: HERMES Messaging (The Nervous System)

**Objective:** Enable secure, peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted messaging between verified identities.
**Canonical Reference:** `docs/spec-hermes-messaging-v0.md`

### 2.1 Data Model & Schema (`packages/data-model`)
- [x] **Schema Definition:** Implement `Message` and `Channel` exactly as defined in `docs/spec-hermes-messaging-v0.md` §2 in `packages/data-model/src/schemas/hermes/message.ts`:
    - `Message`: includes `id`, `channelId`, `sender`, `recipient`, `timestamp`, `type`, encrypted `content`, and `signature`.
    - `sender` / `recipient` are set to the session nullifier (`SessionResponse.nullifier`), the canonical identity key across TRINITY.
    - `Channel`: includes `id` (deterministic hash of sorted participant keys), `participants`, `lastMessageAt`, `type: 'dm'`.
    - Add `schemaVersion: 'hermes-message-v0' | 'hermes-channel-v0'` fields for forward-compatibility.
    - **Note:** Group chats (`type: 'group'`) are explicitly v1+. Sprint 3 is strictly 1:1 DMs.
- [x] **Validation:** Zod schemas for strict runtime checking.
- [x] **Types:** Export TypeScript types to `packages/types`.
- [x] **Channel ID Helper:** Implement `deriveChannelId(participants: string[]): string` in `packages/data-model`, defined as `sha256(sort(participants).join('|'))`. Use browser-safe crypto from `@vh/crypto`. All messaging code must use this canonical derivation.

### 2.2 Transport Layer (`packages/gun-client`) & Messaging Store (`apps/web-pwa`)

#### 2.2.1 Gun Adapters (`packages/gun-client`)
- [x] **Gun adapters:** Expose helpers using identity keys (nullifiers):
    - `getHermesInboxChain(identityKey: string) -> ChainWithGet<Message>`
    - `getHermesOutboxChain(identityKey: string) -> ChainWithGet<Message>`
    - `getHermesChatChain(identityKey: string, channelId: string) -> ChainWithGet<Message>`
- [x] **Namespace Topology:** Implement paths per `spec-hermes-messaging-v0.md` §3.1:
    - `~<recipient_identityKey>/hermes/inbox` — Sender writes encrypted message reference here.
    - `~<sender_identityKey>/hermes/outbox` — Sender writes copy for multi-device sync.
    - `~<user_identityKey>/hermes/chats/<channelId>` — Local view of the conversation.
- [x] **Hydration Barrier:** All helpers must respect `waitForRemote` before writes.

#### 2.2.2 Encryption Wrappers (`packages/gun-client/src/hermesCrypto.ts`)
- [x] **Implement encryption helpers:**
    - `deriveSharedSecret(recipientDevicePub: string, senderDevicePair: SEA.Pair): Promise<string>`
    - `encryptMessagePayload(plaintext: HermesPayload, secret: string): Promise<string>`
    - `decryptMessagePayload(ciphertext: string, secret: string): Promise<HermesPayload>`
- [x] **HermesPayload:** `{ text?: string; attachmentUrl?: string; attachmentType?: 'image' | 'file' }`
- [x] **Implementation:** Use `SEA.secret`, `SEA.encrypt`, `SEA.decrypt` exactly as described in `spec-hermes-messaging-v0.md` §3.2.
- [x] **Privacy:** Do not leak plaintext into Gun; encrypted payload only.

#### 2.2.3 Messaging Store (`apps/web-pwa/src/store/hermesMessaging.ts`)
- [x] **Implement `useChatStore` (Zustand)** that only depends on:
    - `@vh/gun-client` (for graph I/O)
    - `@vh/data-model` (for Zod validation)
    - `@vh/types` (for identity / trustScore)
- [x] **API:**
    - `sendMessage(recipientIdentityKey, plaintext, type: 'text' | 'image' | 'file')`
    - `subscribeToChannel(channelId) -> unsubscribe()`
- [x] **Internally:**
    - Derive `channelId` via `deriveChannelId`.
    - Encrypt + sign, then write to:
        - Recipient inbox (`~recipient/hermes/inbox`)
        - Sender outbox (`~sender/hermes/outbox`)
        - Local chat history (`~sender/hermes/chats/<channelId>`)
- [x] **Deduplication:** De-duplicate messages by `id` when building channel history.
- [x] **Error Handling:**
    - On Gun put error (`ack.err`), mark message as `status: 'failed'` in `useChatStore`. Do not retry automatically.
    - On timeout, follow the "proceed without ack" model from `gun-client`, but keep `status: 'pending'` until message is reflected in inbox/history.
- [x] **E2E Mock (Messaging):** When `VITE_E2E_MODE=true`, inject an in-memory `useChatStore` implementation:
    - Same public API (`sendMessage`, `subscribeToChannel`).
    - Stores messages in local memory only.
    - Does not touch `@vh/gun-client` or open any network connections.

### 2.3 UI Implementation (`apps/web-pwa`)

#### 2.3.1 Components
- [x] `ChatLayout`: Split view (Channel List / Message Thread).
- [x] `ChannelList`: Virtualized list of active conversations.
- [x] `MessageBubble`: Sent/Received styles, timestamp, status (sending/sent/failed).
- [x] `Composer`: Input area with auto-expanding text, send button.
- [x] `ContactQR`: Displays current device's identity key (nullifier) as QR code.
- [x] `ScanContact`: Camera-based QR scanner with fallback to manual entry on desktop.

#### 2.3.2 Features
- [x] **Direct Messages (1:1 only):**
    - Start chat by:
        - Scanning a QR code containing the peer's identity key (nullifier), or
        - Pasting their identity key manually.
    - **No global user search or central directory in v0.**
- [x] **Contact QR & Scanner:**
    - Add "Share Contact" button that shows the current device's identity key as a QR code.
    - Add "Scan Contact" flow (uses camera where available; falls back to manual entry on desktop).
- [x] **Optimistic UI:** Display messages immediately while syncing in background.

#### 2.3.3 Identity & UX Constraints
- [x] **Identity Requirement:** If `useIdentity()` has no active identity/session, the Messaging UI shows a "Create identity to start messaging" gate instead of the chat UI.
- [ ] **Device Label (Optional v0):** When multiple devices are linked, show which device a message came from. Reserve a `deviceId` field in the Message schema for this purpose.

---

## 3. Phase 2: HERMES Forum (The Agora)

**Objective:** A threaded conversation platform combining Reddit-style threads with VENN's bias/counterpoint tables.
**Canonical Reference:** `docs/spec-hermes-forum-v0.md`

### 3.1 Data Model (`packages/data-model`)

- [x] **Schema Definition:** Implement `Thread` and `Comment` exactly as defined in `docs/spec-hermes-forum-v0.md` §2 in `packages/data-model/src/schemas/hermes/forum.ts`:
    - `Thread`: has `score = (upvotes - downvotes) * decayFactor`.
    - `Comment`: uses `type: 'reply' | 'counterpoint'` and optional `targetId` for counterpoints.
    - Add `schemaVersion: 'hermes-thread-v0' | 'hermes-comment-v0'`.
    - Add `sourceAnalysisId?: string` to `Thread` for linking back to VENN analysis.
    - **Note:** No separate `Counterpoint` type; `Comment` with `type: 'counterpoint'` and `targetId` covers it.
- [x] **Content Size Limits:**
    - `title`: ≤ 200 characters.
    - `content`: ≤ 10,000 characters.
- [x] **Validation:** Use Zod schemas, exported via `packages/types`.

- [x] **Storage Topology:** Implement Gun storage paths per `spec-hermes-forum-v0.md` §5:
    - Threads: `vh/forum/threads/<threadId>`
    - Comments: `vh/forum/threads/<threadId>/comments/<commentId>`
    - Indexes:
        - `vh/forum/indexes/date`
        - `vh/forum/indexes/tags/<tag>/<threadId>`

- [x] **Score & Decay:** Implement score computation as:
    - `score = (upvotes - downvotes) * exp(-λ * ageInHours)`
    - λ ≈ 0.0144 (half-life ~48h). Document the chosen λ in the spec comments.
    - Encapsulate this in a `computeThreadScore(thread, now)` helper in `packages/data-model`.

### 3.2 Forum Store (`apps/web-pwa/src/store/hermesForum.ts`)

- [x] **Implement `useForumStore` (Zustand)** that depends on:
    - `@vh/gun-client` (for graph I/O)
    - `@vh/data-model` (for Zod validation)
    - `@vh/types` (for identity / trustScore)
- [x] **One-Vote-Per-User:** Track vote state per `(user, targetId)`. Updating a vote overwrites the previous one.
- [x] **E2E Mock (Forum):** When `VITE_E2E_MODE=true`, use an in-memory `useForumStore`:
    - Manages threads/comments in memory.
    - Skips Gun entirely.
    - Still enforces trust gating (`trustScore >= 0.5`) using the local identity hook.

### 3.3 UI Implementation (`apps/web-pwa`)

#### 3.3.1 Components
- [x] `ForumFeed`: List of active threads sorted by engagement/time.
- [x] `ThreadView`: Main post + nested comment tree.
- [x] `CommentNode`: The comment content + "Counterpoints" side-panel or expandable section.
- [x] `NewThreadForm`: Form for creating new threads with title, content (Markdown), and tags.
- [x] `CounterpointPanel`: Side-by-side view for original argument and counterpoint(s).

#### 3.3.2 Features
- [x] **Structured Debate:** Users can reply normally OR post a "Counterpoint" which appears distinctly next to the original point (side-by-side or expandable section).
- [x] **Sorting Options:**
    - **Hot:** Descending `score` (includes decay).
    - **New:** Descending `timestamp`.
    - **Top:** Descending `(upvotes - downvotes)` (no decay).
- [x] **Auto-collapse:** Low-score content (negative votes) auto-collapses in the UI.
- [x] **Markdown Sanitization:** Sanitize all Markdown before rendering to prevent XSS (`marked` + `dompurify`).

#### 3.3.3 Trust Gating
- [x] **Trust gating:** All "New Thread", "Reply", "Counterpoint", and Vote buttons are disabled unless:
    - There is an active session/identity, AND
    - `identity.session.trustScore >= 0.5` (as per `spec-hermes-forum-v0.md` §4.1).
- [x] **Non-attested users can still read threads/comments.**

#### 3.3.4 Voting Semantics (v0)
- [x] **Raw Vote Storage:** Persist raw upvotes/downvotes as 1 person = 1 vote (no weighting in storage).
- [x] **One-Vote-Per-User:** For each `(user, targetId)`, only one vote is allowed. Updates overwrite.
- [x] **XP-Weighted Score (Client Only):** Compute a derived XP-weighted score in the client/UI only:
    - `weightedScore = Σ sign(vote) * f(civicXP, tag)`
    - For Sprint 3, implement `f` as a simple monotonic function, e.g., `1 + log10(1 + civicXP_tag)`, but keep the raw counts canonical.
    - **Implementation Note:** Base scoring is in place; XP-weighting is a v1 enhancement using the local XP ledger.
- [x] **Privacy:** Never store per-nullifier XP alongside content in Gun; XP reads come from the local XP ledger only.

#### 3.3.5 VENN Integration
- [x] **VENN Integration:** From a Canonical Analysis view, expose a "Discuss in Forum" CTA that:
    - Creates (or navigates to) a Thread tagged with the analysis/topic id.
    - Stores a `sourceAnalysisId` field on the Thread (string, optional) to link back.

## 3.4 XP Hooks – Messaging, Forum & Projects (v0)

**Goal:** XP feels like proto-income for real civic work, not a lootbox for button mashing.

### 3.4.1 General XP Rules (v0)

**XP Types & Scope:**
- `socialXP`: Interpersonal graph & messaging (HERMES Messaging).
- `civicXP`: Public discourse & deliberation (HERMES Forum, later VENN).
- `projectXP`: Concrete project/proposal work (Forum threads tagged `Project` / `Proposal`).

**Monotonic, Local-Only:**
- XP is monotonic in v0: only increases; no clawbacks (even if content is later downvoted).
- XP is stored only in the on-device XP ledger (`spec-xp-ledger-v0.md`).
- No `{nullifier, XP}` or raw XP values are written to Gun, relays, or chain.

**Trust Gating:**
- **Messaging XP:** Requires an active LUMA session (identity + attestation). Adds no extra trustScore threshold beyond the global session gate.
- **Forum XP:** Requires `trustScore >= 0.5` on the current session, same as Forum write/vote gating.

**Caps (Defaults, Tunable):**

Per nullifier, local-only:
- **Daily caps:**
    - `socialXP`: max +5/day.
    - `civicXP`: max +15/day.
- **Weekly cap:**
    - `projectXP`: max +20 per rolling 7-day window.

Emission parameters (caps, amounts, thresholds) are Season 0 defaults and can be changed in future versions without retro-editing historical XP.

### 3.4.2 Messaging XP (`socialXP`) – "Build Real Ties, Not Spam"

**Goal:** Reward forming & sustaining real relationships, not blasting cold DMs.

**A. First Contact Bonus**
- **Event:** User sends the first DM ever to a given identity key (new contact).
- **Reward:** +2 `socialXP`.
- **Constraints:**
    - Only once per unique contact (per nullifier lifetime).
    - Hard cap: at most 3 first-contact XP events per day (theoretical +6, but global cap clips at +5/day).

**B. Sustained Conversation Bonus**
- **Event:** A DM channel between two identities qualifies as a sustained conversation:
    - Within any 48h window:
        - Each participant has sent ≥3 messages, AND
        - Total messages in that window ≥6.
- **Reward:** +1 `socialXP` to each participant.
- **Constraints:**
    - At most 1 sustained-conversation bonus per channel per 7-day window per participant.
    - Only awarded if the user has an active LUMA session at the time the condition is detected.

**C. Daily Messaging Cap**
- Total messaging-derived XP is clipped at +5 `socialXP` per day per nullifier.
- If a new event would exceed the daily cap, award only the remaining room (or zero).

### 3.4.3 Forum XP (`civicXP`) – "Reward Received Contributions, Not Just Noise"

**Goal:** XP flows to people thinking in public (threads, comments, counterpoints) and having other verified humans find that work useful.

**A. Base Participation XP**

**New Thread (Authoring)**
- **Event:** User creates a new Forum Thread (any tag).
- **Reward:** +2 `civicXP` to the author (once per thread).
- **Constraints:**
    - XP only if `trustScore >= 0.5` at creation time.
    - At most 3 XP-earning thread creations per day → max +6 `civicXP`/day from thread creation.

**Substantive Comment / Counterpoint**
- **Event:** User posts a Comment (`type: 'reply' | 'counterpoint'`) with "substantive" content (heuristic: ≥280 chars).
- **Reward:**
    - On a thread **not** authored by the commenter: +1 `civicXP` for the first 3 substantive comments per thread (per user).
    - On a thread authored by the commenter: +1 `civicXP` for the first 2 substantive comments per thread (per user), then 0 (prevents infinite self-bumping).
- **Constraints:**
    - Global cap: at most +10 `civicXP` per day from comment/counterpoint creation.

**B. Quality Bonus XP (Community Reception)**

All quality bonuses trigger on net score:
```typescript
netScore = upvotes - downvotes; // from verified voters only (trustScore >= 0.5)
```

XP is awarded once on crossing each threshold (track per `{contentId, threshold}` locally).

**Thread Quality Bonuses**
- **Event:** A Thread authored by the user crosses thresholds:
    - `netScore >= 3` (previously <3): +1 `civicXP`.
    - `netScore >= 10` (previously <10): +2 `civicXP`.
- **Cap:** Max +3 `civicXP` per thread from quality bonuses.

**Comment / Counterpoint Quality Bonuses**
- **Event:** A Comment (reply or counterpoint) crosses thresholds:
    - `netScore >= 3`: +1 `civicXP`.
    - `netScore >= 10`: additional +1 `civicXP` (total +2).
- **Cap:** Max +2 `civicXP` per comment from quality bonuses.

**No Negative XP in v0**
- If scores later drop (e.g., from 5 to -1), XP is not clawed back. Emissions are strictly monotonic in v0.

**C. Voting**
- **No XP from Votes (v0):** Casting up/downvotes does not grant XP.
- **Rationale:** Voting is cheap and easily farmed. In Season 0, XP should mostly reward higher-friction work: writing threads, comments, counterpoints that others endorse.

### 3.4.4 Project XP (`projectXP`) – "From Talk → Build"

**Goal:** Encourage users to start & maintain real projects/proposals, and to contribute quality critique and design help. This is proto "creator income".

Project XP rides on Forum structures and tags.

**A. Project / Proposal Threads**

**Project/Proposal Thread Creation**
- **Event:** User creates a Thread tagged `Project` or `Proposal` (canonical tag set).
- **Reward:**
    - +2 `projectXP` to the author.
    - +1 `civicXP` to the author (on top of the base +2 `civicXP` from thread creation, if applied).
- **Constraints:**
    - At most 2 XP-earning Project/Proposal threads per 7-day window per user.

**B. Project Updates (For Initiators)**

**Milestone Update Comments (Author Only)**
- **Event:** On their own Project/Proposal thread, the author posts a comment flagged `isUpdate = true` with substantive content (progress, roadmap, budget, etc.).
- **Reward:** +1 `projectXP` per qualifying update.
- **Constraints:**
    - At most 3 update-credits per project thread per 7-day window per author.

**C. Collaborator Contributions (Other Participants)**

**Substantive Collaborator Comment**
- **Event:** User posts a substantive comment/counterpoint on a Project/Proposal thread they did not author, and that comment later reaches `netScore >= 3`.
- **Reward:**
    - On posting: +1 `civicXP` (from general comment rules).
    - On hitting `netScore >= 3`: additional +1 `projectXP` (quality-confirmed collaboration).
- **Constraints:**
    - At most 2 collaborator `projectXP` events per project thread per user.
    - At most +5 `projectXP` per week from collaborator contributions per user.

**D. Outcome Bonus (Optional v0, S0-Configurable)**

**Funded / Selected Projects**
- **Event:** A curated process (off-chain tool or governance script) marks a Project/Proposal thread as funded/selected (e.g., QF outcome).
- **Reward:** One-time +5 `projectXP` to the primary author.
- **Scope, Season 0:**
    - Dev/curator-driven only; no public UI for triggering.
    - Lets you prototype a "founder bonus" without wiring XP→RVU yet.

### 3.4.5 Restatement: Privacy & Topology

- XP, XP deltas, and `{district_hash, nullifier, XP}` tuples are **never** written to Gun, relays, or chain.
- Messaging & Forum see only:
    - Identity-level keys (nullifier / stable pubkey).
    - Trust gating info (does this session meet the threshold? yes/no).
    - Raw thread/comment scores and content per existing specs.
- **XP → GWC linkage stays off-chain in Season 0:**
    - XP is the local participation ledger that will later prototype RVU distribution weights (`spec-rvu-economics-v0.md` §8).
    - Season 0: Clients may show local XP dashboards and simulated "share of pool" numbers, but no on-chain minting logic depends on XP yet.

### 3.4.6 XP Implementation Tasks

**Centralized XP Logic:** All XP emission logic lives in a dedicated module to prevent XP updates from scattering across React components.

- [x] **XP Ledger Helpers (`apps/web-pwa/src/store/xpLedger.ts`):**
    - Implement `useXpLedger` (Zustand) managing `XpLedger` per `spec-xp-ledger-v0.md`.
    - Expose:
        - `applyMessagingXP(event: MessagingXPEvent): void` — handles first-contact and sustained-conversation bonuses.
        - `applyForumXP(event: ForumXPEvent): void` — handles thread/comment creation and quality bonuses.
        - `applyProjectXP(event: ProjectXPEvent): void` — handles project creation, updates, and collaborator bonuses.
    - Internally enforce daily/weekly caps and track per-entity thresholds (e.g., `{contentId, threshold}` for quality bonuses).
    - Store ledger in `localStorage: vh_xp_ledger`.

- [x] **Wire XP Updates from Messaging Store:**
    - In `useChatStore`, after successful `sendMessage`:
        - Emit `MessagingXPEvent` for first-contact bonus (if new contact).
        - Emit `MessagingXPEvent` for sustained-conversation bonus (if 48h window criteria met).
    - Call `useXpLedger.applyMessagingXP(event)`.

- [x] **Wire XP Updates from Forum Store:**
    - In `useForumStore`, after successful thread/comment creation:
        - Emit `ForumXPEvent` with `type: 'thread_created' | 'comment_created'`.
    - On vote count changes (observed via subscription):
        - Emit `ForumXPEvent` with `type: 'quality_bonus'` when thresholds crossed.
    - Call `useXpLedger.applyForumXP(event)`.

- [x] **Unit Tests for XP Module:**
    - First-contact bonus fires once per contact, respects 3/day cap.
    - Sustained-conversation bonus respects 48h window and 1/week/channel limit.
    - Thread/comment creation XP respects daily caps and self-comment limits.
    - Quality bonus fires exactly once per `{contentId, threshold}`.
    - Project XP respects weekly caps.
    - No XP emitted when `trustScore < 0.5` for Forum events.
    - Monotonicity: XP never decreases.

---

## 4. Phase 3: Verification & Hardening

### 4.1 App Store Wiring (E2E)
- [x] **App Store Wiring (E2E):** Ensure `init()` (in `useAppStore`) checks `VITE_E2E_MODE` and:
    - Skips `createClient()` / Gun init.
    - Wires Messaging to in-memory `useChatStore` mock.
    - Wires Forum to in-memory `useForumStore` mock.
    - Still enforces trust gating using the local identity hook.

### 4.2 Automated Tests

#### 4.2.1 Unit Tests (100% Coverage)
- [x] `Message` & `Channel` Zod schemas (valid/invalid cases).
- [x] `Thread` & `Comment` schemas (including `type: 'counterpoint'` and optional `targetId` cases).
- [x] `deriveChannelId` determinism (same inputs → same output).
- [x] Encryption helpers: `encryptMessagePayload` / `decryptMessagePayload` round-trips.
- [x] `computeThreadScore` decay behavior over time.
- [x] TopologyGuard: assert invalid paths are rejected for HERMES/Forum namespaces.

#### 4.2.2 Integration Tests (Vitest)
- [x] `useChatStore.sendMessage` writes to inbox/outbox/chats with no plaintext in Gun.
- [x] Message deduplication by `id` works across inbox/outbox/chats.
- [x] Forum store:
    - Cannot create threads/comments when `trustScore < 0.5`.
    - Can vote only once per user per target; updates are idempotent.
- [x] XP emission:
    - First contact bonus fires once per contact.
    - Daily caps are respected.
    - Quality bonuses fire on threshold crossing.

#### 4.2.3 E2E Tests (Playwright, with `VITE_E2E_MODE=true`)

**Multi-User E2E Infrastructure (Implemented):**
- [x] **SharedMeshStore:** In-memory mock mesh shared across isolated Playwright browser contexts (`packages/e2e/src/fixtures/multi-user.ts`).
- [x] **User Fixtures:** `alice` and `bob` fixtures with `context.exposeFunction` for cross-context mesh sync.
- [x] **Unique E2E Identities:** Each mock identity gets a unique nullifier to prevent collision in multi-user tests.
- [x] **Testing Strategy:** Documented in `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`.

**Single-User Flows:**
- [x] **Golden Path E2E:** Identity → Attestation → Wallet → UBE → Analysis (`full-flow.spec.ts`).
- [x] **Tracer Bullet:** Basic Identity → Analysis loop (`tracer-bullet.spec.ts`).

**Multi-User Flows:**
- [x] **Isolated Contexts:** Alice and Bob have separate identities; both can access HERMES.
- [x] **Shared Mesh Sync:** Data written by Alice is visible to Bob via shared mesh.
- [x] **Forum Integration:**
    - Authenticated user with `trustScore >= 0.5` creates thread, reply, and counterpoint.
    - User with `trustScore < 0.5` can read but sees "verify identity" gate on write/vote.
- [x] **Messaging E2E:**
    - Bob enters Alice's identity key and sends a message.
    - Alice sees the message via shared mesh sync.

### 4.3 Manual Verification Plan

#### 4.3.1 Messaging
- [ ] Open App in two browser windows (Incognito).
- [ ] Create two identities.
- [ ] Start DM via QR scan or manual key entry.
- [ ] Exchange messages.
- [ ] Verify persistence (reload page).
- [ ] **Verify encryption:** Inspect the raw Gun payload under `~<recipient_identityKey>/hermes/inbox` and confirm it is encrypted (no message text visible in dev tools).
- [ ] **Multi-device sync:** Link a second device and confirm chat history appears on both after hydration.

#### 4.3.2 Forum
- [ ] Create Thread.
- [ ] Post Comment.
- [ ] Add Counterpoint to Comment.
- [ ] Verify visual layout (side-by-side or distinct expandable section).
- [ ] **Auto-collapse:** Verify that hiding low-score content (auto-collapse) kicks in when votes are negative.
- [ ] **Sorting:** Verify that "Hot" sorting differs from "New" for older-but-upvoted threads.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| GunDB sync latency for real-time chat | Aggressive local caching and optimistic UI. |
| Plaintext leakage in mesh | E2EE via SEA; integration tests assert encrypted payloads only. |
| Scope creep (group chat, push notifications) | Defer explicitly to v1+; strict backlog hygiene. |
| Identity/trust divergence | Reuse `useIdentity` hook; single source of truth for trustScore. |
| E2E test flakiness with network mocks | True Offline Mode with full mocks; no network I/O in E2E. |
| XP farming / Sybil attacks | Caps, substantive content heuristics, quality-gated bonuses. |
