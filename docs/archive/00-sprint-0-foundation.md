# Sprint 0: The Foundation - Implementation Checklist

**Context:** `System_Architecture.md` v0.0.1 (Single Source of Truth)
**Note:** This sprint is archived. Canonical Analysis is now formalized in `System_Architecture.md` §6.3 and `docs/canonical-analysis-v1.md`.
**Goal:** Establish the Monorepo, Hardware Roots of Trust, security posture, and basic mesh connectivity required for Milestone A readiness.
**Status:** [ ] In Progress

### Guiding Constraints from the System Architecture
- [x] Zero-Trust & Forward Secrecy requirements captured in a visible checklist.
- [x] Local-First data plan documented (CRDT conflict policy, offline queues, hydration barrier).
- [x] AI-driven development guardrails codified (LOC caps, module boundaries, 200% coverage).
- [x] Vite + React + Node 20 + pnpm confirmed as the canonical toolchain.

---

## Phase 0: Architecture Lock-In (Day 0)

### 0.1 Source-of-Truth Adoption
- [x] Publish `System_Architecture.md` to `/docs` and reference it from `README`.
- [x] Add `ARCHITECTURE_LOCK.md` summarizing Zero-Trust, Local-First, and Local-Only storage guarantees.
- [x] Capture risk register (Lamport overflow, TURN cost, AI drift) in `docs/risks.md`.

### 0.2 Quality Gates & Tooling Alignment
- [x] Configure `.nvmrc` → Node 20 LTS and `.npmrc` → `strict-peer-dependencies=false`.
- [x] Document `200% coverage` expectations in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- [x] Add `pnpm test:quick`, `pnpm test:workflow`, `pnpm test:e2e` scripts as stubs that fail until implemented.

**DoD:** Architecture version referenced in every spec, guardrail scripts exist, and CI fails if scripts are missing.

---

## Phase 1: Repository & Infrastructure (Day 1-3)

### 1.1 Monorepo Scaffolding
- [x] **Init:** Initialize `pnpm` workspace with `apps/`, `packages/`, `services/`, `infra/`, `tools/`.
- [x] **Config:** Configure `tsconfig.base.json` (Strict Mode, no implicit any, no unchecked indexed access).
- [x] **Linting:** Configure `eslint` with **custom rule** to warn at 250 LOC and fail at 350 LOC.
- [x] **Testing:** Configure `vitest` workspace-wide.
- [x] **Pre-commit:** Setup `husky` to run lint + test:quick on commit.
- [x] **Module Graph:** Add `madge` (or `dpdm`) check to CI for circular dependencies.
- [x] **Browser Discipline:** Add ESLint rule to forbid Node built-ins in `apps/*` + `packages/ui`.

### 1.2 The `vh` CLI (Developer Experience)
- [x] **Scaffold:** Create `tools/scripts/vh` entry point (Node.js CLI).
- [x] **Cmd:** Implement `vh bootstrap init` (Generate local secrets for MinIO/Turn/JWT).
- [x] **Cmd:** Implement `vh bootstrap up` (Docker Compose orchestration).
- [x] **Docker:** Create `infra/docker/docker-compose.yml` (MinIO, Gun-Relay, CoTURN, Aggregators).
- [x] **Cmd:** Implement `vh bootstrap check` to run TLS/TURN diagnostics defined in System Architecture §6.2.
- [x] **Cmd:** Add `vh dev` (stack + PWA) and `vh test:quick` wrappers.

### 1.3 CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] **Workflow:** Create `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
- [x] **Gate:** Ensure pipeline fails on Coverage < 100%.
- [x] **Gate:** Ensure pipeline fails on Circular Dependencies (`madge` or `dpdm`).
- [x] **Gate:** Ensure pipeline fails on LOC violations (350 line hard cap).
- [x] **Gate:** Add Lighthouse budget placeholder (Perf ≥ 90, A11y ≥ 90).
- [x] **Gate:** Enforce bundle size alert (PWA ≤ 1 MiB gzipped).

**DoD:** `pnpm lint` + `pnpm test:quick` + `vh bootstrap up` succeed locally and on CI, and automation reflects all Section 5 & 9 requirements.

---

## Phase 2: Core Packages & Identity (The Bedrock)

### 2.1 Core Libraries
- [x] **Types:** Create `packages/types` (Zod schemas & TS Interfaces).
- [x] **Crypto:** Create `packages/crypto` (E2EE primitives, wrappers for `window.crypto.subtle`).
- [x] **CRDT:** Create `packages/crdt` (Lamport, LWW, Vector Clocks).
- [x] **Data:** Create `packages/data-model` (High-level Entities: Msg, Post).
- [x] **Gun Client:** Create `packages/gun-client` with hydration barrier + graph pruning scaffolding.

### 2.2 Hardware Attestation (The Root)
- [x] **Spec:** Define `AttestationPayload` interface in `packages/types`.
- [x] **Native (iOS):** Implement Capacitor plugin stub for `DCAppAttestService` (Swift).
- [x] **Native (Android):** Implement Capacitor plugin stub for `KeyGenParameterSpec` (Kotlin).
- [x] **Service:** Build `services/attestation-verifier` (Rust/WASM) to verify Apple/Google cert chains.
- [x] **Test:** Write `attestation.test.ts` using mock certificates.

### 2.3 LHID Core & Networking
- [x] **Graph:** Initialize `packages/gun-client` (Strict Isolation - The ONLY package importing `gun`).
- [x] **Auth:** Implement `createSession(attestation)` -> returns `UniquenessNullifier`.
- [x] **Storage:** Implement `EncryptedStorageAdapter` (IndexedDB + WebCrypto).
- [x] **Outbox:** Scaffold offline queue + retry policy following Local-First mandate.
- [x] **Docs:** Capture hydration barrier and conflict resolution strategy (Lamport + LWW + CRDT sets) in `packages/crdt/README.md`.

**DoD:** Demo script can issue attestation, exchange encrypted payload through `gun-client`, and pass unit tests for CRDT conflict resolution.

## Phase 2.2: Guardian Node Deployment (Geekom)

- [x] **OS:** Ubuntu Server 24.04 installed & SSH secured.
- [x] **Deps:** Docker, Node 20, pnpm installed.
