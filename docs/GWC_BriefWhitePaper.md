Global Wealth Chain (GWC)
The Ironclad Substrate for the Post-Labor Economy

Version: 1.0 (The "Ironclad" Release) Date: November 20, 2025 Status: Execution Phase (Season 0)

Abstract
The Global Wealth Chain (GWC) is a decentralized public utility designed to solve the two existential crises of the 21st century: the debasement of fiat currency and the decoupling of human labor from economic value due to Artificial Intelligence.

GWC introduces the Global Wealth Unit (GWU), a floating index-token that mirrors global net wealth in real terms. Unlike stablecoins, GWU is not pegged to debt (fiat); it is anchored to a regulated benchmark of civilization’s equity. This is paired with the Resource Exchange Layer (REL), a hardware-secured marketplace where verified humans convert intentional attention into computational capabilities and liquidity.

Secured by Hardware-Attested Identity (PoP v3), Memory-Hard Verifiable Delay Functions, and MACI Anti-Collusion Governance, GWC offers a mathematically and legally resilient life-raft for the transition to a post-labor economy.

Tagline: Your share of world wealth, measured in real terms. Not a claim. Not a peg. The protocol is the promise.

1. The Manifesto: The Protocol is the Promise
1.1 The Twin Crises

We stand at a fracture point in history.

The Crisis of Value: Fiat currencies are designed to inflate, punishing savers. As sovereign debt spirals, the purchasing power of the individual is systematically eroded.

The Crisis of Labor: AI is driving the marginal cost of cognition to zero. The traditional mechanism for distributing wealth—wages for labor—is breaking. We face a future of abundance for capital owners and obsolescence for workers.

1.2 The Solution

We cannot patch this system. We must build a parallel substrate. We need a store of value that tracks Total Global Wealth, not the policy whims of central banks. We need a mechanism that values Human Agency, ensuring that even in a world of super-intelligence, the human right to participate in the economy is cryptographically guaranteed.

GWC is that substrate. It is the "Iron Bank" of the people—legitimate, real, secure, and fair.

2. The Wealth Layer: The Global Wealth Unit (GWU)
2.1 The Concept: A Purchasing Power Mirror

GWU is not a stablecoin. Stablecoins are pegged to fiat, inheriting the inflation and political risk of the dollar or euro. GWU is a Index-Tracking Crypto-Asset. It is designed to preserve purchasing power by mirroring the RGU-Real-v1 benchmark—a comprehensive index of global equities, commodities, real estate, and broad money, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP).

2.2 The Mechanism: Floating, Not Pegged

The system enforces the invariant S(t)=I(t) (Supply equals Index Value) through a triple-lock mechanism:

Continuous Primary Issuance Auctions (CPIA): When demand drives the price above the index (P>NAV), the protocol auctions new GWU to the market, capturing the premium into a Public Purse.

Permissionless ArbVaults: Automated vaults dampen volatility within defined bands, buying and selling to keep the price aligned with the index without guaranteeing a fixed redemption.

Bounded Open Market Operations (OMO): If the price falls significantly below the index (P<NAV), the protocol utilizes the Public Purse reserves to buy back and burn GWU, supporting the floor.

2.3 The Legal Shield: BMR Compliance

To ensure durability against regulatory capture, the RGU-Real-v1 index is registered under the EU Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) .

Classification: GWU is a crypto-asset referencing a regulated benchmark.

Compliance: This legally differentiates GWU from "Asset-Referenced Tokens" (ARTs) under MiCA, as we offer no fixed redemption claim to a single fiat currency. We offer exposure to a transparent, audited measure of wealth.

3. The Resource Exchange Layer (REL): The Human Union
3.1 The Pivot: Data as Labor

In a world of AI, the most scarce resource is not computation, but Verified Human Intent. AI models are collapsing on synthetic data; they require high-quality, human-verified feedback (RLHF) to function. The REL organizes this scarce resource. It acts as a Global Data Labor Union.

Attention Units (AU): Users earn AU by performing verified "Intent Tasks" (e.g., ranking AI outputs, labeling data).

Monetization: These AU are converted via single-price auctions into Fee Credits or Compute Credits (CC), funded by B2B contracts with AI labs paying for our clean data stream.

3.2 The Firewall: Human vs. Agent

We explicitly separate the economy into two lanes to prevent AI dominance:

Human Lane: Requires Hardware Attestation. Can mint AU.

Agent Lane: Can only spend GWU to buy Compute. Cannot mint AU. This ensures that the upside of the AI economy flows to human participants.

4. The Ironclad Technical Stack
We reject the fragility of current crypto-systems. We build for a hostile 2025 threat landscape.

4.1 Identity: Hardware Attestation (PoP v3)

Software liveness (selfies) is dead, killed by injection attacks which increased 700% in 2024 . GWC Standard: We require Cryptographic Hardware Attestation.

Verification requires a signature from the device’s Secure Enclave (TEE) and Hardware ISP, proving the data stream originated from a physical camera sensor, not software .

This renders deepfake injection attacks mathematically impossible.

4.2 Time: Memory-Hard VDFs (PoPat)

To prevent bot swarms from overwhelming the network, we utilize Proof of Patience.

We implement Memory-Hard Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) (e.g., MinRoot).

Unlike standard VDFs, these resist ASIC acceleration by binding computation to memory latency . A bot farm cannot "out-wait" a human by throwing hardware at the problem.

4.3 Governance: MACI Anti-Collusion

We prevent plutocracy and vote-buying.

All Token House governance utilizes Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI).   
Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, voting is receipt-free. A user cannot prove to a briber how they voted, making vote-buying markets economically unviable.

5. The Roadmap: Seasons of Execution
We do not promise a finished utopia. We promise a disciplined march toward antifragility.

Season 0: The Foundations (Current)

Objective: Solvency & Security.

Deliverables: Wallet v1 (Sanctuary Mode), PoP v3 (Hardware Attestation), GWU Core (BMR Registration), MACI Governance.

Metric: Zero successful injection attacks in red-team drills.

Season 1: The Labor Union

Objective: Revenue Generation.

Deliverables: Launch of "Intent Tasks" focused on RLHF for major AI labs. Revenue flows to Public Purse to support GWU.

Metric: >$10M annualized revenue from Data Labor contracts.

Season 2: The Compute Market

Objective: Resource Utility.

Deliverables: Compute Credits (CC) with Proof-of-Delivery transcripts. Permissionless GPU marketplace.

Metric: 99% reliability on decentralized compute jobs.

6. Conclusion
The Global Wealth Chain is not an experiment. It is a defensive structure for the human race.

We offer a deal:

To the Saver: We offer a unit of account that cannot be debased by printing presses.

To the Worker: We offer a marketplace where your humanity—your intent, your attention, your validation—is the ultimate asset.

To the Regulator: We offer a transparent, compliant, and regulated benchmark that brings stability to the digital asset class.

We are building the Iron Bank. It is time to secure your share of the future.

Join the GWC. The Protocol is the Promise.
