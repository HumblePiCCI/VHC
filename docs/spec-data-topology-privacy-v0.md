# Data Topology & Privacy – Season 0 Spec

Version: 0.1  
Status: Canonical for Sprints 2–3

This spec defines where data lives (device, mesh, chain, cloud), what is public vs sensitive, and the rules for handling civic/identity/constituency data in Season 0.

## 1. Object Inventory & Locations

## 2. Classification & Rules

- **Public-by-design:** CanonicalAnalysis, AggregateSentiment (per topic, per district), QF project totals/funding amounts.
- **Sensitive:** IdentityRecord (attestation, nullifier), RegionProof/ConstituencyProof, per-user SentimentSignals, messages & social graph, wallet↔nullifier mappings.

Rules:
- Only Public objects may be stored plaintext under `vh/*` in the mesh.
- Sensitive objects either stay on-device or travel via encrypted channels (user-scoped Gun space, outbox to Guardian Nodes).
- `district_hash` and `nullifier` never appear together in any public structure; no identity/constituency data in CanonicalAnalysis.
- XP ledger (per nullifier) is sensitive; only safe aggregates with cohort thresholds may be exposed.
- Public mesh objects MUST NOT include delegation grants, familiar IDs, or agent logs in plaintext.
- If exported to a Guardian/aggregator, delegation data MUST be encrypted and still obey the existing `{district_hash, nullifier}` separation rules.

## 3. Sentiment & Constituency Flow

- Event-level `SentimentSignal` (sensitive):
  - Lives on-device.
  - May be sent encrypted to a Guardian Node/regional aggregator.
  - Never stored plaintext on the public mesh.

- Aggregates (public):
  - Guardian Nodes aggregate per `(district_hash, topic_id, point_id)`:
    - counts (agree/disagree/neutral),
    - aggregated weight (sum or avg).
  - Only these aggregates (no nullifiers) are exposed to dashboards/reps.

- On-chain:
  - Governance/economic contracts (UBE, QF, Faucet) are region-agnostic and never see `district_hash`.

## 4. Gun Mesh Policy

- Allowed plaintext namespaces:
  - `vh/analyses/<urlHash>` → CanonicalAnalysis.
  - Aggregate sentiment namespaces without per-user IDs (e.g., `vh/aggregates/<topicId>`).
- Disallowed plaintext:
  - `vh/signals/*` with per-user SentimentSignal.
  - `vh/users/<nullifier>/*` with identity-mapped data.
- `chat` / `outbox`:
  - Season 0: no production use until E2EE is implemented.
  - Dev-only writes must be behind feature flags.

## 5. Aggregation Safety

- Minimum cohort size: do not publish per-district stats until at least `N` distinct nullifiers for `(district_hash, topic)` (e.g., N=20).
- Rounding/binning: public dashboards show rounded percentages/bins for small samples.
- No cross-linkage: UI never exposes per-user sentiment history joined with district info.

## 6. Test Invariants

- Static checks: no Gun write paths of the form `vh/users/<nullifier>/...` in production code; no public types combining `{ district_hash, nullifier }`.
- Runtime tests: ensure CanonicalAnalysis stored in mesh has no identity/constituency fields; sentiment UI updates change local stores/aggregated mock outputs only.
- Docs/impl alignment: topology table spot-checked each major release.
