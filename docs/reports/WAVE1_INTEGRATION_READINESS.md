## Cross-Team Integration Results

### A + B: StoryBundle -> SynthesisV2 pipeline
Validated clustering and synthesis candidate gathering integration:
- `packages/ai-engine/src/pipeline.test.ts`
- `packages/ai-engine/src/candidateGatherer.test.ts`
- News adapter/store compatibility checks also exercised via:
  - `packages/gun-client/src/newsAdapters.test.ts`
  - `apps/web-pwa/src/store/news/index.test.ts`

Result: ✅ Pass

### B + C: Feed renders news cards from real StoryBundle-shaped data
Validated feed card rendering against discovery/news schema:
- `apps/web-pwa/src/components/feed/NewsCard.test.tsx`
- `apps/web-pwa/src/components/FeedList.test.tsx`

Result: ✅ Pass

### A + C: Feed synthesis panel from V2 synthesis data
Validated V2 synthesis hook/store and card rendering:
- `apps/web-pwa/src/hooks/useSynthesis.test.ts`
- `apps/web-pwa/src/components/feed/TopicCard.test.tsx`
- `apps/web-pwa/src/store/synthesis/index.test.ts`

Result: ✅ Pass

### D: Delegation grants consume correct budget pools
Validated grant lifecycle, budget guards, and UI path:
- `apps/web-pwa/src/store/delegation/index.test.ts`
- `apps/web-pwa/src/store/xpLedgerBudget.test.ts`
- `apps/web-pwa/src/components/hermes/FamiliarControlPanel.test.tsx`

Result: ✅ Pass

---

## Privacy Lint / Public Path Safety

Checks performed:
- `packages/gun-client/src/topology.test.ts` pass
- Manual verification of `packages/gun-client/src/topology.ts` classifications
- Adapter validation guards reviewed for forbidden sensitive fields in public mesh paths

Result: ✅ Pass

---

## LOC Audit

Audit scope: `apps/**/src`, `packages/**/src`, `services/**/src` (excluding tests/spec files/typechain-generated artifacts).

Result: ✅ Pass
- Max observed source file length at cap (350), no source files exceeding 350 LOC.

---

## Feature-Flag Validation

### Legacy-safe mode
Command:
- `VITE_FEED_V2_ENABLED=false VITE_TOPIC_SYNTHESIS_V2_ENABLED=false pnpm test:quick`

Result: ✅ Pass

### V2-enabled mode
Command:
- `VITE_FEED_V2_ENABLED=true VITE_TOPIC_SYNTHESIS_V2_ENABLED=true pnpm test:quick`

Result: ✅ Pass

---

## Blocker #164 Closure

Issue: global `pnpm test:coverage` baseline failures.

Resolution implemented (without lowering thresholds):
- Added/expanded targeted coverage for discovery ranking/store and synthesis/discovery integration paths.
- Hardened feature-flag env resolution to support test/runtime node env stubbing and browser env fallback.
- Kept threshold policy intact; no global threshold reduction.

Outcome:
- `pnpm test:coverage` now passes repo-wide at 100%.
- Issue closed: `gh issue close 164`.

---

## Open Risks

No merge-blocking risks identified.

Non-blocking notes:
- Existing expected console warnings in tests (CSP image denials in E2E/offline mode, router warning noise in certain component tests) remain informational and unchanged by this pass.

---

## Recommendation

**GO** — integration branch is ready for `integration/wave-1 -> main` merge with required checks enforced.

---

## Post-Merge Follow-up Plan (queue only; do not execute in this pass)

Feature-flag lifecycle retirement plan for:
- `VITE_FEED_V2_ENABLED`
- `VITE_TOPIC_SYNTHESIS_V2_ENABLED`

Planned follow-up PR (after main merge verification):
1. Verify main post-merge smoke with flags both OFF and ON in CI/nightly.
2. Remove flag branches and dead legacy code paths in feed/synthesis wiring.
3. Update tests to single canonical V2 behavior path.
4. Update docs/changelog and remove flag references from runbooks.
5. Re-run full gate matrix before merging flag-removal PR.
