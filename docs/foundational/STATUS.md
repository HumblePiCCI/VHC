## Wave 2 Landed Capabilities (2026-02-13)

Wave 2 delivered the following features across 3 workstreams and 36 PRs to `integration/wave-2`, merged to `main` via Policy 15 sync PRs (#218, #221).

### W2-Alpha — Comment-Driven Re-synthesis (PRs #192, #197, #199, #202)
- `CommentTracker` module: per-topic verified comment counting with epoch-aware state (`commentTracker.ts`)
- `DigestBuilder`: rolling `TopicDigestInput` construction from comment activity (`digestBuilder.ts` — W2A-2)
- Re-synthesis trigger wiring: comment count threshold → epoch scheduler trigger, forum comment integration (`resynthesisWiring.ts`)
- Full test coverage on all touched modules

### W2-Beta Stage 1 — Reply-to-Article + Docs MVP (PRs #190, #198, #201)
- `ForumPost` and `HermesDocs` Zod schemas + `docsAdapters` for Gun mesh sync
- 240-character reply cap enforcement in `CommentComposer`
- "Convert to Article" CTA when reply exceeds cap
- `hermesDocs` Zustand store with CRUD, flag-gated via `VITE_HERMES_DOCS_ENABLED`
- `ArticleEditor` (draft/edit) and `ArticleViewer` (read) components
- `ArticleFeedCard` integrated into discovery feed under `ARTICLE` feed kind

### W2-Beta Stage 2 — Collaborative Docs Foundation (PRs #214, #217, #219, #220)
- `@vh/crdt` package: Yjs provider, `AwarenessAdapter`, dedup module for CRDT sync
- Document key management: `deriveDocumentKey`, `shareDocumentKey`, `receiveDocumentKey`, `encryptDocContent`, `decryptDocContent` (`docsKeyManagement.ts`)
- `CollabEditor` component: TipTap + Yjs binding, lazy-loaded (229 LOC)
- `PresenceBar` component: collaborator cursor/presence indicators via AwarenessAdapter (66 LOC)
- `ShareModal` component: collaborator add/remove, role selection, trust threshold checks (261 LOC)
- `hermesDocsCollab` store: collab runtime state, auto-save (5s encrypted), offline pending indicator
- `hermesDocsAccess` store: pure access control functions (`getAccessLevel`, `canEdit`, `canView`, `canShare`, `canDelete`)
- Document key localStorage persistence (`vh_docs_keys:<nullifier>`)
- Feature flags: `VITE_HERMES_DOCS_ENABLED` + `VITE_DOCS_COLLAB_ENABLED` gate collab runtime
- E2E bypass: `VITE_E2E_MODE=true` → `MockGunYjsProvider` (no Yjs/Gun init)
- 204 new tests, 100% line+branch coverage on all touched modules

> **Note:** Stage 2 is foundation-only. `CollabEditor` is built and tested but NOT wired into the active `ArticleEditor` path. Runtime wiring is Wave 3 scope (see `WAVE3_CARRYOVER.md`).

### W2-Gamma Phase 1 — Linked-Social Substrate (PR #207)
- Schema convergence: `LinkedSocialAccount` and `SocialNotification` with strict Zod validation
- Vault token substrate: `OAuthTokenRecord` with vault-only storage enforcement
- Notification ingestion pipeline with sanitization

### W2-Gamma Phase 2 — Elevation Artifacts + Budget Gates (PR #209)
- Elevation schema tightening with Zod validation
- Artifact generators: `BriefDoc`, `ProposalScaffold`, `TalkingPoints`
- `civic_actions/day` budget gate enforcement (budget key #7 of 8 now active)
- Trust threshold checks for elevation nominations

### W2-Gamma Phase 3 — Social Feed Wiring (PR #211)
- `SocialNotificationCard` real-data rendering (replaces mock)
- `socialFeedAdapter`: notification → feed item mapping with dismiss/seen state
- Feed integration: social notifications in `Social` surface and `All` feed

### Wave 2 Governance Infrastructure (20 coord/* PRs)
- CE dual-review contracts codified and enforced for all execution dispatches
- Ownership map expanded for all 3 workstreams (glob patterns per Policy 2)
- Wave 2 delta contract: 16 binding policies defined and enforced
- Policy 4 exception documented (serialized merge fallback)
- Policy 14 repo migration parity verified post-transfer
- Policy 15 periodic sync enforced (PRs #218, #221)
- Context rotation guard enforced (Policy 13)

## Wave 2 Deferred Items (CEO Decision 2026-02-13)

The following items were explicitly deferred to Wave 3 by CEO decision:

| Item | Reason | Carryover Doc |

| W2-Gamma Phase 4 (receipt-in-feed) | DeliveryReceipt schema needs spec work; additive to landed foundation | `WAVE3_CARRYOVER.md` |
| SoT F: Rep directory + native intents | CAK foundation landed; full delivery pipeline is Wave 3 priority | `WAVE3_CARRYOVER.md` |
| CollabEditor runtime wiring | Foundation built and tested; wiring into ArticleEditor path deferred | `WAVE3_CARRYOVER.md` |

## Product Direction Deltas (A-G)

| Direction Delta | Target (Ship Snapshot) | Current Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| A. V2-first synthesis | `TopicSynthesisV2` (quorum + epochs + divergence) is canonical | ✅ Types, candidate gatherer, quorum engine, epoch scheduler, store, Gun adapters (Wave 1) + re-synthesis triggers, comment tracking, digest builder (Wave 2 Alpha) |
| B. 3-surface feed | Feed mixes `News`, `Topics`, and `Linked-Social Notifications` | ✅ Discovery feed shell with all three card types + real social notification wiring (Wave 1 + Wave 2 Gamma P3) |
| C. Elevation loop | Nomination thresholds produce BriefDoc + ProposalScaffold + TalkingPoints + rep forwarding | 🟡 Elevation schema + artifact generators + budget gates landed (Wave 2 Gamma P2); receipt-in-feed deferred to Wave 3 |
| D. Thread + longform rules | Reddit-like sorting, 240-char replies, overflow to Docs article | ✅ Forum sorting + 240-char reply cap + Convert-to-Article CTA + ArticleFeedCard (Wave 2 Beta S1) |
| E. Collaborative docs | Multi-author encrypted docs, draft-to-publish workflow | 🟡 Full foundation: CRDT/Yjs, E2EE key management, collab editor, presence, sharing, access control (Wave 2 Beta S2); runtime wiring into ArticleEditor deferred to Wave 3 |
| F. Civic signal → value rails | Eye/Lightbulb capture thought-effort; aggregate civic signal drives future REL/AU | 🟡 Budget guards (7/8 keys active), elevation artifacts landed; rep directory + native intents deferred to Wave 3 |
| G. Provider switching + consent | Default local WebLLM; remote providers opt-in with cost/privacy clarity | ✅ Local default path wired; remote engine opt-in with local-first policy; provider consent UI in place |

## Security Considerations

### Mitigations in Place

- ✅ Identity stored in encrypted IndexedDB vault
- ✅ Topology guard prevents unauthorized Gun writes
- ✅ Encryption required for sensitive mesh paths
- ✅ XP ledger is local-only
- ✅ Participation governors enforce rate limits (7/8 budget keys active)
- ✅ TOCTOU hardening on concurrent budget operations
- ✅ Attestation verifier has structured validation and rate limiting
- ✅ AI engine default is truthful (LocalMlEngine in non-E2E)
- ✅ Document keys derived per-document, never stored on mesh (Wave 2)
- ✅ OAuth tokens vault-only, never on public paths (Wave 2)

## Deployment Status

| Environment | Status | Artifacts |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Localhost (Anvil) | ✅ Working | `deployments/localhost.json` |
| Sepolia Testnet | ✅ Deployed | `deployments/sepolia.json` |
| Base Sepolia | ❌ Not deployed | Script exists |
| Mainnet | ❌ Not planned | — |

## Next Work (Wave 3 Direction)

See `docs/foundational/WAVE3_CARRYOVER.md` for detailed carryover items.

Priority order (CEO directive):
1. **CAK completion** — receipt-in-feed (DeliveryReceipt schema), representative directory, native intents
2. **CollabEditor runtime wiring** — connect CollabEditor into ArticleEditor active path
3. **Feature-flag retirement** — promote Wave 1+2 flags to permanent-on after integration sign-off
4. **Remaining budget key** — `moderation/day` enforcement (key 8/8)
5. **Runtime wiring** — synthesis pipeline → discovery feed UI (v2 end-to-end)
