# TRINITY (VENN/HERMES × LUMA × GWC) — Season 0 Ship Snapshot (V2‑First)

**Purpose:** one **single tree** that gives **frontend + backend** devs the full picture (UX surfaces + contracts + privacy boundaries + gates).  
**Stance:** **Design & build for Synthesis V2**. Anything labeled V1 is **legacy/compat only**.  
**Legend:** ✅ Implemented · 🟡 Partial · 🔴 Stubbed · ⚪ Planned  
**Last updated:** 2026‑02‑08

---

- **TRINITY Bio‑Economic OS (Season 0)** — UX: “clean news + structured disagreement + legible recognition”; Tech: local‑first identity + edge AI + mesh + economic rails
  - **Non‑negotiables (Product / UX / Policy)**  
    - **A — V2‑first synthesis**: quorum + epochs + divergence; V1 is legacy/compat only  
    - **B — Topics feed has 3 surfaces**: **News**, **Topics/Threads**, **Linked‑Social Notifications**  
    - **C — Elevation to projects**: News/Topics/Articles can be nominated; thresholds → auto‑draft brief + proposal scaffold; users can forward to reps via email/phone  
    - **D — Reddit‑like thread mechanics**: sort New/Top; peer‑votes affect visibility; Reply ≤ **240 chars**; overflow → “Convert to Article” (Docs)  
    - **E — Collaborative docs**: multi‑author E2EE P2P drafting; private iteration → publish to feed  
    - **F — GWC thesis**: value attention/thought‑effort; redirect value to humans (not advertisers); REL/AU later  
    - **G — AI provider switching**: default **WebLLM**; allow user‑selected remote providers + local models; explicit opt‑in + cost/privacy clarity

  - **Season 0 defaults (numbers devs should code against unless explicitly changed)**  
    - **Trust gates:** Human ≥ **0.5** (`scaled ≥ 5000`); QF (future/curated) ≥ **0.7** (`scaled ≥ 7000`)  
    - **Synthesis epochs:** debounce **30 min**; daily cap **4/topic**  
    - **Topic re‑synthesis (discussion‑driven):** every **10 verified comments** with **≥3 unique verified principals** since last epoch  
    - **Early accuracy pass:** first **5 verified opens** produce critique/refine candidates (per topic epoch)  
    - **Budgets/day (per principal nullifier):** posts=20, comments=50, sentiment_votes=200, governance_votes=20, analyses=25 (max 5/topic), shares=10, moderation=10, civic_actions=3  
    - **UBE (“Daily Boost”):** 1/day; `minTrustScore=5000`; drip ≈ **25 RVU** (Season 0 default)

  - **Prime Directives (engineering hard constraints)** ✅ (target architecture)
    - **Local is Truth** ✅ — UX: fast/offline; identity + sensitive civic state on device; mesh/chain only public or encrypted replicas  
    - **Physics is Trust** 🟡/🔴 — UX: verified humans matter; Tech: hardware attestation intended; current verifier is dev‑stub  
    - **Math is Law** 🟡 — UX: support becomes legible + anti‑plutocracy later; Tech: QF now, MACI later  
    - **Shared Reality** 🟡 — UX: same synthesis view for everyone; Tech: deterministic V2 quorum selection per epoch  
    - **Civic Facilitation (no dark automation)** ⚪ — UX: user‑initiated email/phone/share/export; no default form submission  
    - **Human Sovereignty (Familiars)** 🟡/⚪ — UX: assistants help but don’t multiply influence; Tech: scoped/expiring/revocable grants; inherit principal budgets  
    - **Strict Discipline** ✅ — 350 LOC cap (tests/types/ABI exempt) + 100% line/branch coverage gate

  - **Hero loops (what the user experiences)** 🟡
    - **Civic Dignity Loop** — UX: “I read, I judge; my district signal moves; I’m recognized”
      - Onboard → (optional) prove district → feed → open topic → stance on frames → see aggregates → claim Daily Boost  
    - **Governance / Elevation Loop** — UX: “this matters → it becomes a project → support is visible → it reaches reps”
      - Nominate story/topic/article → threshold → auto‑draft brief + proposal scaffold → simulated QF support → forward‑to‑rep (email/phone)  
    - **Docs / Longform Loop** — UX: “draft privately → collaborate → publish → discuss → elevate”
      - E2EE doc draft → publish as topic → thread engagement → auto‑nominate (articles) → elevate

  - **User‑visible UI surfaces (front‑end map)** 🟡
    - **App Shell / Navigation** ✅ — UX: stable app frame; boot/hydrate before high‑impact actions  
    - **Unified Topics Feed (3 surfaces)** 🟡 — UX: one stream; filter chips: All / News / Topics / Social; sort: Latest / Hottest / My Activity
      - **TopicCard (shared)** 🟡 — UX: headline/title + category tags + 👁 Eye + 💡 Lightbulb + comment count  
      - **NewsCard (clustered story)** ⚪ — UX: **one headline = one story** synthesized across outlets; tap opens TopicDetail  
      - **TopicCard (user topic/thread)** 🟡 — UX: looks like news once discussion is rich enough (summary + frames + thread)  
      - **SocialNotificationCard** ⚪ — UX: platform badge; tap expands to embedded platform view; swipe‑left returns & dismisses card  
    - **Topic Detail (“one object, two lenses”)** 🟡 — UX: synthesis up top; conversation below; stable, readable, non‑churny
      - **Synthesis Panel (V2)** ⚪/🟡 — UX: “just‑the‑reported‑facts” + Frame/Reframe table; epoch badge; warnings if sources disagree  
      - **Frame/Reframe Table (stance grid)** 🟡 — UX: per row: Agree (+1) / Neutral (0) / Disagree (‑1); toggles are 3‑state, no spam  
      - **Thread Lens (Forum)** ✅/🟡 — UX: Reddit‑like; sort New/Top; votes float good replies; stance‑aware threading  
      - **Reply Composer** ⚪/🟡 — UX: 240‑char hard limit; “Convert to Article” CTA when exceeded  
      - **Article Viewer / Doc‑backed Post** ⚪ — UX: longform reads like a doc; still has comments + votes underneath  
      - **Proposal / Support Widget** 🟡 — UX: “Support” amount A → shows **voice credits = A²**; shows estimated match in hypothetical pool  
    - **Control Panel / Profile** 🟡 — UX: “my score, my boosts, my impact”
      - **Daily Boost button** 🟡 — UX: claim once/day → XP bump; (optional) testnet RVU mint behind scenes  
      - **XP Tracks** ✅ — UX: civicXP / socialXP / projectXP (simple bars/number)  
      - **Wallet (Advanced)** 🟡 — UX: RVU balance + claim status for testers; hidden behind “Advanced”  
      - **District Dashboard** ⚪/🟡 — UX: per‑district aggregates + comparisons; never shows individual stance  
    - **Messaging (HERMES)** 🟢 — UX: private chat + group coordination (also where Familiar control lives)  
      - **Familiar Control Panel** 🟡/⚪ — UX: create/revoke grants; see what the familiar can do; review “high impact” requests  
    - **Docs (HERMES Docs)** ⚪ — UX: collaborative editor (multi‑author), private by default; publish as Topic/Article  
    - **Civic Action Kit (Bridge)** ⚪ — UX: “make it real” without creepy automation
      - **Rep Contact Directory** ⚪ — UX: picks reps for your district; shows public email + phone  
      - **Export/Share actions** ⚪ — UX: generate brief PDF; open mailto/tel/share‑sheet; store a receipt locally

  - **Core domain objects (shared contracts devs should align on)** 🟡
    - **Identity (LUMA primitives)** 🟡/🔴 — Tech: gates everything valuable; UX: “verified humans count”
      - `trustScore: 0..1`, `scaledTrustScore: 0..10000`  
      - `principalNullifier` (UniquenessNullifier) — invariant across civic signals + XP ledger + economic attestations  
      - `ConstituencyProof { district_hash, nullifier, merkle_root }` — district attribution without doxxing  
      - **Roles:** Guest (read‑only) → Human (PoH) → Constituent (PoH + RegionProof)
    - **Unified Topic (the feed atom)** 🟡 — Tech: one topicId across analysis + thread + metrics; UX: one card type
      - `topicId` (deterministic)  
      - `kind: NEWS_STORY | USER_TOPIC | SOCIAL_NOTIFICATION`  
      - `categories[]` (interest tailoring + discovery)  
      - `thread` (always present): Thread carries `{ topicId, isHeadline, sourceUrl?, urlHash? }` ✅  
      - `synthesis` (latest): `{ schemaVersion:'topic-synthesis-v2', epoch, synthesisId }` ⚪  
      - `metrics`: `{ eye, lightbulb, comments, hotness }` 🟡  
    - **News story clustering (Aggregator → StoryBundle)** ⚪ — Tech: 1 story = many sources; UX: 1 headline in feed
      - RSS ingest → normalize → cluster → **StoryBundle** (sources + dedup)  
      - Synthesis input is **all reporting** on the story (not a single URL)  
      - Frames/counterframes come from bias/perspective patterns *across outlets* (plus thread digest)
    - **Topic Synthesis V2 (epochal + quorum)** ⚪/🟡 — UX: stable “versioned” updates, not constant churn
      - Inputs:
        - News: `StoryBundle` (+ optional `TopicDigest`)  
        - User topic: `TopicSeed` + rolling `TopicDigest`  
      - Per‑epoch pipeline:
        - gather **N=5** candidate syntheses (verified submission gate)  
        - candidates must critique/refine prior epoch (“accuracy mandate”)  
        - quorum synthesizer emits: `factsSummary`, `frames[]`, `warnings[]`, `divergenceMetrics`, `provenance`  
        - deterministic selection so all peers show the same accepted synthesis
    - **Civic signals (Eye / Lightbulb / Sentiment)** 🟡 — UX: simple toggles, capped influence
      - **Civic Decay** ✅ — `next = current + 0.3*(2-current)` (monotonic; bounded [0,2])  
      - **Eye** 🟡 — per‑user/topic read interest ∈ [0,2]; updated on “full read”; aggregate shown in feed/dashboards  
      - **Lightbulb** 🟡 — per‑user/topic engagement ∈ [0,2]; updated on stance changes; aggregate shown in feed/dashboards  
      - **Sentiment** 🟡 — tri‑state per `(topic_id, point_id)` in `{+1,0,-1}`  
      - **Privacy boundary** ✅:
        - event‑level `SentimentSignal` is sensitive (device / encrypted channel only)  
        - public surfaces show aggregates only (`AggregateSentiment`, district rollups)  
        - never publish `{district_hash, nullifier}` pairs
    - **Forum (HERMES Forum)** 🟢 — UX: threaded discourse under every topic
      - Threads/comments are public objects; votes affect visibility (not identity)  
      - Stance‑aware threading (concur/counter/discuss) ✅/🟡  
    - **Docs (HERMES Docs)** ⚪ — UX: longform + collaboration
      - Convert Reply → Article; articles can be co‑authored privately then published  
    - **Projects / Proposals (proposal‑threads)** 🟡/⚪ — UX: “topics can become funded projects”
      - Thread has `proposal?: ProposalExtension { fundingRequest, recipient, status, qfProjectId?, ... }` 🟡  
      - Season 0 public: off‑chain simulated support; internal: curated on‑chain QF rounds  
    - **Elevation artifacts** ⚪ — UX: “press‑ready” civic packet
      - `BriefDoc` (communications brief)  
      - `ProposalScaffold` (project framing + funding request)  
      - `TalkingPoints[]` (phone script bullets)  
      - `Receipt` (what was sent, when, to whom — stored locally)

  - **Data topology & privacy (what lives where)** 🟡
    - **On device (authoritative)** ✅
      - Identity vault: encrypted IndexedDB `vh-vault` / `vault`  
      - XP ledger + budgets (per nullifier)  
      - Raw sentiment events + per‑user stance state  
      - Linked‑social OAuth tokens + notification objects (sensitive)  
      - Draft docs (private, E2EE)  
    - **Mesh / Gun (public)** 🟡
      - Public topics + threads/comments  
      - Public syntheses (V2) + public aggregates (no identity leakage)  
    - **Mesh / Gun (encrypted channels)** 🟢/⚪
      - E2EE messaging  
      - Optional encrypted outbox to a Guardian Node (sensitive replication)  
    - **Chain (EVM contracts)** 🟡
      - RVU v0, UBE v0, Faucet (dev), QuadraticFunding, MedianOracle  
      - Season 0: safe defaults; public UX stays “XP‑first”  
    - **Cloud blob store (MinIO/S3)** ⚪
      - Encrypted attachments >100KB (docs exports, media), referenced from mesh objects

  - **Engines & services (back‑end / infra pieces)** 🟡
    - **News Aggregator Service** ⚪ — Tech: RSS ingest → normalize → cluster → StoryBundle; UX: “one story, many sources”
    - **Synthesis Engine (V2 quorum + epochs)** ⚪ — Tech: candidate gather + critique/refine + synthesize + deterministic accept
    - **AI Engine Router (model switching)** 🟡
      - Default: **WebLLM / LocalMlEngine** (edge inference) ✅/🟡  
      - Optional: Remote providers (OpenAI/Google/Anthropic/xAI) ⚪ — requires explicit opt‑in + cost/privacy disclosure  
      - Optional: device‑local model (if available) ⚪ — “free but inconsistent”  
    - **Topic Digest Builder** ⚪ — Tech: rolling digest from comments for re‑synthesis input
    - **Rep Directory / District mapper** ⚪ — Tech: map `district_hash → reps`; UX: “one‑click email/call”
    - **Guardian Node (optional)** ⚪/🟡 — Tech: encrypted storage for sensitive outbox; optional aggregate compute; never receives plaintext identity
    - **Attestor Bridge** 🟡/⚪ — Tech: takes session proofs → registers participants for UBE/QF; Season 0 mostly stubbed

  - **Participation governors (anti‑swarm)** ✅/🟡 — UX: rate limits feel fair; denial explains why
    - **Action budgets (per nullifier/day)** ✅ — posts, comments, votes, analyses, shares, moderation, civic actions  
    - **Compute budget** 🟡 — analyses/day + per‑topic cap  
    - **Familiar inheritance** 🟡 — familiars consume principal budgets; never multiply influence

  - **Implementation reality check (what exists today vs target)** 🟡
    - **VENN analysis pipeline** 🟡 — end‑to‑end pipeline exists; defaults to WebLLM engine in non‑E2E; remote engines not wired  
    - **HERMES Messaging** 🟢 — E2EE working  
    - **HERMES Forum** 🟢 — threads + votes working; unified topics fields landed (`topicId`, `sourceUrl`, `urlHash`, `isHeadline`)  
    - **HERMES Docs** ⚪ — planned (Sprint 5)  
    - **Bridge / Civic Action Kit** ⚪ — planned/redesign (Sprint 5)  
    - **LUMA** 🟡 — Wave 4 hardened: trust constants consolidated, session lifecycle (expiry/revocation), constituency proof verification (flag-gated). TEE/VIO/sybil still stubbed (Season 0 §9.2 deferred)  
    - **GWC contracts** 🟡 — contracts implemented; public testnet deploy incomplete; Season 0 UX should remain XP‑first

  - **Legacy / migration (explicitly non‑blocking but must be tracked)** 🟡
    - CanonicalAnalysisV1 exists in code/specs — **do not design new UX around it**; use V2 TopicSynthesis and treat V1 as compat/migration only
