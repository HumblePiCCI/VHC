# E2E Hero Paths – Season 0

Version: 0.1  
Status: Canonical Storyboards for Sprints 2–3

This document captures two end-to-end “hero paths” for Season 0:

- **Civic Dignity Loop** (news → influence → reward)
- **Governance Loop** (idea → proposal → support)

Each path is described from the user’s point of view and then mapped to concrete types, contracts, and tests across LUMA (identity), VENN (application), and GWC (economics). These loops must remain consistent with:

- `System_Architecture.md`
- `docs/specs/spec-identity-trust-constituency.md`
- `docs/specs/spec-civic-sentiment.md`
- `docs/specs/spec-rvu-economics-v0.md`
- `docs/specs/canonical-analysis-v1.md`
- `docs/foundational/AI_ENGINE_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/specs/spec-data-topology-privacy-v0.md`

## 1. Hero Path 1 – Civic Dignity Loop

> *“I read, I judge, my district’s signal moves, and the system recognizes that.”*

### 1.1 Narrative (User Perspective)

1. **I become “real” in the system**

   - I install the app or open the PWA.
   - I go through onboarding and end up with an account that is “me”: one human, not just one device.
   - At some point I complete Proof of Human (attestation). Optionally, I prove my region so the app knows I am a constituent of District X.
   - After this, the app treats me differently from a guest:
     - My actions can move civic metrics,
     - I am eligible for a small daily boost.
   - Optional: I configure a **familiar** (delegated agent) to draft/triage. It acts on my behalf with scoped, expiring grants; all actions count against my budgets and do not multiply my influence. I manage it in Messaging via a Familiar Control Panel (local-only).

2. **I scroll my Topics stream**

   - I see a list of Topics (external headlines + user threads + linked-socials notifications).
   - Each card shows:
     - Headline & source,
     - A small **Eye** indicator (how much real reading interest the story has),
     - A **Lightbulb** indicator (how much engaged judgment the story has attracted).
   - I can scroll this stream even as a guest; but only as an attested human do my actions move those metrics.

3. **I open a topic and get the “clean view”**

   - Clicking any Topic card opens a single, familiar screen:
     - **Neutral summary** at the top (facts only),
     - A **Frame / Reframe table** directly beneath,
     - The **discussion thread** continues below the table.

   - The Frame/Reframe table is the *system’s current best synthesis* of:
     - the source article (if there is one), **and**
     - the evolving forum discussion for this Topic.

   - The page feels like one object with two lenses:
     - **Analysis lens:** “What’s going on, and what are the competing frames?”
     - **Forum lens:** “What do people in the network actually think and say?”

   - **Reanalysis cadence (discrete refresh, not continuous churn):**
     - During the **first N opens** (default: 5), each analysis re‑reads the original article/post and **critiques/refines** the prior summary + Frame/Reframe table with the express intent of maximum accuracy. Each candidate is distributed on the mesh.
     - Every **N verified comments** thereafter (default: 50, min 8 unique verified principals), the Topic is re-analyzed using:
       - the original article/topic context, plus
       - a digest of the newest discussion.
     - Debounce: at most one refresh per 30 minutes; daily cap: 4 per topic.
     - If the synthesis changes, the Frame/Reframe table updates (and a new analysis version is shown).

   - Direction note: v1 is first-to-file; v2 will synthesize from a quorum of candidate analyses.

4. **I express my judgement**

   - For each cell (frame or reframe) I can:
     - Agree (**+1**),
     - Disagree (**-1**),
     - Or stay neutral (**0**).
   - The controls are simple 3‑state toggles:
     - Tapping + again returns to neutral,
     - Switching from + to – flips the stance.
   - When I interact:
     - The row’s local sentiment indicator moves (ratio of agree/disagree),
     - The article’s **Lightbulb** (engagement) increases slightly for *me*,
     - My personal “score” on the control panel ticks up (civic XP track).

5. **I see my district’s signal**

   - In a **Constituent Dashboard**, I can see:

     - For my district:
       - % agree / disagree on specific claims (aggregated per bias row),
       - Which topics are “hot” by engagement.
     - For the wider network:
       - How my district compares to others on the same topic.

   - My individual stance is not displayed beyond the read/lightbulb indicators being illuminated if I've read/registered sentiment by tapping on **+ / –** controls; I only see aggregated results. But it’s clear that my actions contribute to these curves.

6. **I get a small daily boost**

   - Once per day, as an attested human, I can claim a **Daily Boost**.
   - In the UI this shows up as:
     - A “Boost” button / status in the control panel,
     - An increase in my visible score (XP).
   - Under the hood, this is backed by a UBE claim (Season 0) and an off‑chain XP ledger.

7. **Being a good citizen is legible**

   - My stream is cleaner than a standard doomscroll,
   - I can see all sides of stories,
   - My reactions roll up into district‑level signals,
   - I get tangible recognition (score now, RVU later) for participating thoughtfully.

This is the **Civic Dignity Loop**: identity → news → analysis → stance → district‑level influence → daily recognition.

### 1.2 Under the Hood (S0–S2 Implementation)

#### 1.2.1 Identity & Trust (LUMA)

- **Types & specs:**
  - `TrustScore` (0..1) and `ScaledTrustScore` (0..10000) per `spec-identity-trust-constituency.md`.
  - `UniquenessNullifier` – stable per-human key (string off-chain, `bytes32` on-chain).
  - `RegionProof` → `ConstituencyProof { district_hash, nullifier, merkle_root }`.

- **Client:**
  - `useIdentity` calls the attestation-verifier and persists `IdentityRecord` in the encrypted IndexedDB vault (`vh-vault` database, `vault` object store) protected by a per-device master key.
  - Runtime identity access is in-memory via identity provider APIs:
    - `getPublishedIdentity()` returns the public session snapshot (`nullifier`, `trustScore`, `scaledTrustScore`).
    - `getFullIdentity()` returns the full same-process record for consumers that require private fields (for example, chat encryption helpers).
  - Legacy key `vh_identity` is migration-only input (read once, then deleted), not active persistence.
  - `vh:identity-published` is emitted only as a hydration signal and carries no identity payload.

- **Roles:**
  - **Guest:** no trustScore/nullifier in state; can read but does not move canonical metrics or earn XP.
  - **Human (PoH):** trustScore ≥ 0.5 (scaled ≥ 5000).
    - Eligible for UBE/Faucet.
    - Their sentiment & engagement contribute to aggregates.
  - **Constituent:** Human + valid RegionProof.
    - Their sentiment participates in district-level aggregates (by `district_hash`).

> Invariant: For the same human, the `nullifier` is consistent across identity, sentiment (SentimentSignal.constituency_proof.nullifier), and UBE/QF attestations.

#### 1.2.2 Feed → Canonical Analysis (VENN + AI Engine)

- **Data model:**
  - `CanonicalAnalysisV1` from `docs/specs/canonical-analysis-v1.md`:
    - `url`, `urlHash`,
    - `summary`,
    - `bias_claim_quote`, `justify_bias_claim`, `biases`, `counterpoints`,
    - Optional `perspectives: { frame, reframe }[]`,
    - `sentimentScore`, `confidence?`,
    - Optional `engine` metadata and `warnings[]`.

- **Generation:**
  - AI pipeline per `AI_ENGINE_CONTRACT.md`:
    - `buildPrompt(articleText)` constructs the prompt with goals/guidelines and JSON wrapper.
    - `EngineRouter` chooses a remote or local model (Season 0 default: `local-only`; remote requires explicit opt-in).
    - Model returns wrapped JSON (`step_by_step` + `final_refined`) parsed and validated via `AnalysisResultSchema`.
    - Output is canonicalized into `CanonicalAnalysisV1` and validated by `CanonicalAnalysisSchema`.

- **Storage & topology:**
  - Per `docs/specs/spec-data-topology-privacy-v0.md`:
    - CanonicalAnalyses are **public**:
      - Stored on-device: `localStorage: vh_canonical_analyses` and IndexedDB `vh-ai-cache/analyses`.
      - Optionally replicated plaintext to mesh: `vh/analyses/<urlHash>`.
    - They do **not** include any identity or constituency data.

- **UI:**
- Topics stream reads `CanonicalAnalysisV1` to render summary and bias table.
  - Eye & Lightbulb are computed from per-topic Eye/Lightbulb weights (see below).

##### 1.2.2.1 Topic Digest → Reanalysis Loop (Frame/Reframe evolves)

- **Goal:** Keep the Topic’s summary + Frame/Reframe table aligned with the live conversation without allowing constant churn or spam-driven drift.

- **Digest (local-first, policy-driven):**
  - The client (or a familiar in **Suggest** mode) maintains a rolling `TopicDigest` for each `topicId`.
  - The digest is derived from recent comments and includes:
    - recurring claims/themes,
    - the strongest competing frames,
    - representative quotes (comment excerpts) for each frame,
    - and a bounded window of recent comment IDs.

- **Reanalysis trigger (discrete epochs):**
  - During the **first N opens** (default: 5), each analysis re‑reads the original article/post and critiques/refines the prior summary + Frame/Reframe table for accuracy.
  - After canonicalization, when the thread receives **N verified** new posts since the last reanalysis epoch (default: 10, min 3 unique verified principals), a new analysis job is created.
  - Qualifying posts are trust-gated, rate-limited, and count only toward the principal nullifier.
  - Debounce: at most one refresh per 30 minutes; daily cap: 4 per topic.

- **Reanalysis input:**
  - `articleText` (if external headline) OR `topicSeed` (if user-born thread)
  - `TopicDigest` (new discussion window)

- **Reanalysis output:**
  - A new canonical analysis (`CanonicalAnalysisV2` when quorum mode is enabled) is produced with updated:
    - `summary`
    - `perspectives[]` (Frame/Reframe rows)
    - optional `warnings[]` (mismatch/uncertainty)

- **Anti-churn rule:**
  - Treat reanalysis as **epochs** (versioned refreshes). “First-to-file” applies per epoch window, not forever.
  - Clients display the latest accepted epoch by deterministic selection (same for all peers).

#### 1.2.3 Sentiment, Eye & Lightbulb (VENN + Sentiment Spec)

- **Types & schemas:**
  - `SentimentSignal` and `AggregateSentiment` from `docs/specs/spec-civic-sentiment.md`.
  - Event-level:

    ```ts
    interface SentimentSignal {
      topic_id: string;
      analysis_id: string;
      point_id: string;
      agreement: 1 | 0 | -1;
      weight: number; // Lightbulb engagement weight [0,2]

      constituency_proof: {
        district_hash: string;
        nullifier: string;
        merkle_root: string;
      };

      emitted_at: number;
    }
    ```

  - Aggregate:

    ```ts
    interface PointStats {
      agree: number;
      disagree: number;
    }

    interface AggregateSentiment {
      topic_id: string;
      analysis_id: string;
      point_stats: Record<string, PointStats>;
      bias_vector: Record<string, 1 | 0 | -1>;
      weight: number;          // aggregate Lightbulb
      engagementScore: number; // optional dispersion/spread metric
    }
    ```

- **Per-user state (client):**
  - `useSentimentState`:
    - Stores `agreement ∈ {-1,0,1}` per `(topic_id, point_id)` (3‑state toggle).
  - `useEngagementState`:
    - Stores **Lightbulb** `lightbulb_weight(topic_id, user)` ∈ `[0,2]`.
    - Updates via Civic Decay on *engagement interactions* (stance changes).
  - `useReadState` (or `useReadTracker`):
    - Stores **Eye** `eye_weight(topic_id, user)` ∈ `[0,2]`.
    - Updates via Civic Decay on each full read/expand of the analysis.

- **Civic Decay function:**

  From `docs/specs/spec-civic-sentiment.md`:

  ```ts
  // One step toward 2.0
  next = current + 0.3 * (2.0 - current);

Invariants:
	•	Monotonic,
	•	Bounded in [0,2],
	•	One qualifying interaction = one step.
	•	Metrics semantics:
	•	Eye (Read Interest):
	•	Per-user-per-topic eye_weight updated on read/expand.
	•	Aggregate Eye:
	•	Deterministic function of all eye_weight values (sum).
	•	Optional secondary metric: count of users with eye_weight > 0.
	•	Lightbulb (Engagement):
	•	Per-user-per-topic lightbulb_weight updated on each stance change / engagement.
	•	SentimentSignal.weight = current lightbulb_weight for that topic.
	•	Aggregate Lightbulb:
	•	Deterministic aggregate of per-user lightbulb_weight (sum/avg).
	•	Per-point sentiment:
	•	agreement changes update local state per (topic_id, point_id).
	•	Aggregate point_stats[point_id] count only committed votes:
	•	agree = count of agreement = +1,
	•	disagree = count of agreement = -1,
	•	Neutral (0) is excluded from counts.
	•	Privacy & topology:
	•	Per docs/specs/spec-data-topology-privacy-v0.md:
	•	Event-level SentimentSignal is sensitive:
	•	Lives on-device and/or is sent encrypted to a Guardian Node.
	•	Never stored plaintext in the public mesh.
	•	Mesh / public:
	•	Only AggregateSentiment and other aggregates appear.
	•	No {district_hash, nullifier} pairs in any public structure.

1.2.4 XP & Daily Boost (GWC)
	•	Contracts:
	•	RVU.sol, UBE.sol, Faucet.sol, QuadraticFunding.sol per spec-rvu-economics-v0.md.
	•	UBE parameters (Season 0):
	•	minTrustScore = 5000 (0.5),
	•	claimInterval = 1 day,
	•	dripAmount ~25 RVU.
	•	UX decision (Season 0):
	•	UBE is surfaced in the app as a Daily Boost, not as a DeFi income product.
	•	Behind the scenes:
	•	Successful UBE.claim() can:
	•	Mint testnet RVU to the user’s wallet, and/or
	•	Increment a per-nullifier civic XP ledger.
	•	Faucet remains dev/onboarding-only and is not part of the visible dignity loop.
	•	UI:
	•	useWallet + WalletPanel:
	•	For advanced users/testers, shows RVU balance and raw UBE claim status.
	•	Control panel:
	•	Shows “Daily Boost” status and XP growth.

⸻

1.3 E2E Test Outline – Civic Dignity Loop

A Season 0 E2E test suite should demonstrate:
	1.	Identity and trust gating
	•	Create a new identity via useIdentity with mocked attestation:
	•	Ensure trustScore ≥ 0.5.
	•	Ensure nullifier is present.
	•	Optionally attach a mock RegionProof and verify ConstituencyProof decoding.
	2.	Daily Boost / UBE link
	•	Call UBE.claim() in mock mode (or equivalent XP-only path).
	•	Assert:
	•	Claim succeeds only if trustScore ≥ minTrustScore.
	•	User’s civic XP track increases by the expected amount.
	3.	Canonical analysis loading
	•	Paste a known URL into the app.
	•	Assert:
	•	CanonicalAnalysisV1 is generated or reused (First-to-File behavior).
	•	Entry passes CanonicalAnalysisSchema.parse.
	•	It is stored in the local topics stream and, if configured, appears in vh/analyses/<urlHash> in the mesh.
	4.	Bias table interaction
	•	On a canonical analysis:
	•	Toggle + on a specific point_id.
	•	Assert:
	•	agreement(topic_id, point_id) moves from 0 → +1.
	•	lightbulb_weight(topic_id, user) increases via Civic Decay.
	•	Aggregate sentiment for that point (point_stats) reflects this vote.
	5.	Eye/Lightbulb updates
	•	Open and close the same analysis multiple times:
	•	Assert eye_weight(topic_id, user) increases monotonically and is bounded in [0,2].
	•	Engage multiple times with the table:
	•	Assert lightbulb_weight(topic_id, user) increases monotonically and is bounded in [0,2].
	6.	District dashboard
	•	With a mock district_hash:
	•	Feed several SentimentSignal events (or mocked equivalents) into an aggregate pipeline.
	•	Assert:
	•	Per-district aggregates (point_stats, Eye, Lightbulb) are computed correctly.
	•	No per-user identifiers appear in the public dashboard data structures.

2. Hero Path 2 – Governance Loop

“This article is biased → here’s a better idea → look, people support it.”

2.1 Narrative (User Perspective)
	1.	I start from a topic
	•	I’m on a topic (e.g., “local transit funding”) reading a canonical analysis and its bias/counter table.
	•	Below the analysis, I see the **thread** (discussion) for this Topic.
	2.	Ideas emerge from the thread
	•	Discussion happens in the thread (forum votes affect visibility).
	•	When an idea crystallizes, the thread can be **elevated to a proposal**.
	3.	I elevate a thread to a proposal (verified)
	•	I add funding details (RVU request + recipient).
	•	A familiar can draft these fields, but I must approve elevation.
	•	The thread gets a **Proposal** badge and a Support widget.
	4.	I stake my support (Season 0)
	•	I enter an amount (in “RVU units”) representing my support weight.
	•	The UI shows voice credits = amount² to give me the quadratic feel.
	•	I submit my support:
	•	The proposal’s support metrics update,
	•	My governance/project XP increases,
	•	My control panel shows that I’ve backed this proposal.
	•	In Season 0:
	•	This does not move real RVU for general users;
	•	It is tracked off-chain (and optionally in the mesh) as simulated QF-style voting.
	5.	I see hypothetical funding outcomes
	•	The proposal UI shows “What if this were in a QF round?”:
	•	Estimated matching given a hypothetical pool,
	•	How this proposal compares to others in terms of voice credits.
	6.	Later, proposals become QF-eligible
	•	In future seasons, some proposal-threads become QF projects:
	•	They get a real projectId in the QuadraticFunding contract,
	•	My attested votes can actually route RVU (subject to trust gates).
	•	My earlier participation (XP footprint) influences how the system invites me into these higher-stakes rounds.

This is the Governance Loop: news → idea → proposal → committed support → eventual routing of value through QF.

⸻

2.2 Under the Hood (S0–S2 Implementation)

2.2.1 Proposal & vote data model
	•	Proposals are **threads with a proposal extension** (see `spec-hermes-forum-v0.md`):

```typescript
interface ProposalExtension {
  fundingRequest: string;         // RVU amount (display)
  recipient: string;              // recipient address
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'elevated' | 'funded' | 'closed';
  qfProjectId?: string;           // set when elevated on-chain
  sourceTopicId?: string;         // optional link when multiple proposals exist
  attestationProof?: string;      // optional
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

	•	Vote representation (off-chain):
	•	Season 0: votes are represented as off-chain objects (e.g., ProposalSupport) with fields like:
	•	threadId (proposal thread),
	•	direction (“support” / “oppose”),
	•	amount (numeric),
	•	voter (nullifier in private context),
	•	timestamp.
	•	Front-end:
	•	useGovernance (PWA):
	•	Seeds example proposal-threads and maintains support aggregates locally.
	•	In future, will persist proposal extensions + support events via mesh or local storage.
	•	Topology & privacy:
	•	Per docs/specs/spec-data-topology-privacy-v0.md:
	•	Proposal threads are public objects and may be stored in mesh.
	•	Raw per-user support events may be sensitive depending on identity/constituency linkage:
	•	Publicly: only aggregate support counts and voice credits per proposal.
	•	Privately: structured support histories keyed by nullifier may be kept on-device or via encrypted channels.

2.2.2 Quadratic Funding Engine (GWC)
	•	Contract: QuadraticFunding.sol
	•	Supports:
	•	recordParticipant(address, scaledTrustScore, expiresAt) – attested participants (trust-gated).
	•	registerProject(recipient) – admin/curator registers projects.
	•	castVote(projectId, amount) – contributions (RVU) from participants.
	•	Quadratic weight accounting (sumOfSqrtContributions).
	•	Matching pool funding (fundMatchingPool / poolFunds).
	•	Settlement (closeRound, matchFunds, withdraw).
	•	Season 0 scope (per spec-rvu-economics-v0.md):
	•	Public UX:
	•	Off-chain simulated QF voting (no direct castVote from general users).
	•	Internal/developer use:
	•	Curators and dev accounts exercise full QF flows on testnet with RVU:
	•	Register projects,
	•	Record participants,
	•	Cast votes,
	•	Close and match rounds,
	•	Withdraw funds.

2.2.3 Season 0 decision: sandboxed public governance
	•	Public PWA:
	•	Proposal creation & voting:
	•	Remains off-chain and (initially) local/mesh-only.
	•	Votes update proposal-level aggregates (votesFor, votesAgainst, derived voice credits).
	•	XP:
	•	Supporting proposals increases governance/project XP for the user (ledger keyed by nullifier off-chain).
	•	No on-chain RVU is moved directly from public PWA interactions in Season 0.
	•	Internal QF testing:
	•	Curated proposals are mapped to QF projectIds:
	•	Off-chain mapping: proposalId → projectId.
	•	Curators and test participants:
	•	Use wallets, attestation bridge, and QF contracts to run real matches.
	•	This validates the economic engine without exposing public users to real-money governance yet.

2.2.4 Proposal lifecycle in S0
Off-chain / app level:
	1.	Draft:
	•	User with identity (nullifier) discusses in the thread.
	•	A familiar may draft proposal fields, but elevation requires explicit human approval.
	2.	Elevation:
	•	Thread is elevated to a proposal by adding `thread.proposal`.
	• Proposal references:
	•	Topic(s) (`topic_id` = urlHash or deterministic thread-derived hash),
	•	Optional tags/categories,
	•	Optional attestationProof that the author is in an affected district.
	3.	Support / voting:
	•	When a user supports via the Proposal widget:
	•	A ProposalSupport event is created locally and/or in mesh/private storage.
	•	Support aggregates (support/oppose, voice credits) update.
	•	The user’s project/governance XP increases.

On-chain / internal:
	4.	Curation & registration:
	•	Admin/curators select certain proposal-threads for on-chain QF testing.
	•	They call QuadraticFunding.registerProject(recipient) and maintain mapping to threadId (`qfProjectId`).
	5.	QF test rounds:
	•	Using dev/test accounts:
	•	Participants are attested (recordParticipant).
	•	They cast real castVote transactions.
	•	After the round, curators call closeRound, matchFunds, and withdraw.
	•	Internal dashboards compare:
	•	Off-chain simulated outcomes vs. on-chain actual matches.

Future seasons:
	6.	Public QF activation:
	•	Proposal extension grows an onChainProjectId / `qfProjectId` field.
	•	For QF-enabled proposal-threads, public PWA:
	•	Allows attested users (trustScore ≥ QF threshold) to cast real RVU votes via castVote.
	•	Shows both:
	•	Off-chain voice metrics,
	•	On-chain contribution/match status.

⸻

2.3 E2E Test Outline – Governance Loop

Season 0 tests should demonstrate that the governance loop works end-to-end at the UX and contract levels (even though they are only partially wired together for public users).

2.3.1 App-level governance tests
	1.	Thread elevation
	•	With an attested identity:
	•	Elevate a thread to proposal via the UI.
	•	Assert proposal extension fields are stored on the thread.
	•	Assert the thread shows a Proposal badge + Support widget.
	2.	Support & aggregates
	•	On a proposal-thread:
	•	Submit a “Support” vote with amount A.
	•	Assert:
	•	Local aggregates (support/oppose, derived voice credits) update as expected.
	•	A ProposalSupport record is stored (local or mesh/private).
	•	User’s governance/project XP increased.
	3.	Hypothetical QF projection
	•	Provide a mock QF pool and emulate QF math client-side.
	•	Assert:
	•	The UI’s “Estimated match” matches the math used in QuadraticFunding tests (for the same inputs).

2.3.2 Contract-level QF tests (internal)
	1.	Participant & project registration
	•	Deploy RVU and QuadraticFunding to a testnet/anvil.
	•	Register:
	•	Two projects via registerProject.
	•	Several participants via recordParticipant with trustScore ≥ min QF threshold.
	2.	Voting & matching
	•	Mint RVU to participants.
	•	Have participants cast QF votes (castVote) with varying amounts.
	•	Fund the matching pool via fundMatchingPool / poolFunds.
	•	Close the round and call matchFunds.
	3.	Assertions
	•	Verify:
	•	Quadratic contributions and matching weights align with spec.
	•	withdraw(projectId) transfers the correct total (contributions + matches) to the recipient.
	•	Trust gating works: unregistered/low-trust participants cannot cast votes.
	4.	Simulation alignment
	•	Cross-check:
	•	Off-chain simulated matches (used in the UI) against on-chain matches for the same contributions.

⸻

3. Summary

These two hero paths tie together:
	•	LUMA identity (nullifier, trustScore, RegionProof),
	•	VENN’s AI analysis and sentiment mechanics,
	•	GWC’s UBE, RVU, and Quadratic Funding,
	•	And the Season 0 data topology & privacy rules.

They should be treated as contractual storyboards: if a feature or change breaks one of these loops, it should be considered an architectural regression, not just a UI tweak.
