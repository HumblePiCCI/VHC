# BIO-EC OS: Source of Truth

**Codename:** TRINITY (GWC x LUMA x VENN)
**Version:** 0.2.0 (Sprint 2 Baseline)
**Status:** APPROVED FOR EXECUTION

-----

## 1. The Mission & Prime Directives

TRINITY is a **Parallel Institution**: A self-sovereign Operating System for Identity, Wealth, and Governance. It functions as a digital organism designed to operate without central intermediaries.

**The Triad:**

1.  **LUMA (The Immune System):** Biological reality (Hardware TEE + Biometrics) to filter Sybils.
2.  **GWC (The Circulatory System):** Resource-backed wealth (ZK-Rollup + Oracles) to distribute value.
3.  **VENN (The Nervous System):** Local-first intent sensing (P2P Mesh + Edge AI) to act on information.

**Engineering Prime Directives:**

1.  **Local is Truth:** Data lives on the user's device. The cloud is merely an encrypted relay.
2.  **Physics is Trust:** Keys are bound to hardware (TEE/Enclave), not passwords.
3.  **Math is Law:** Governance is receipt-free (MACI) and anti-collusive.
4.  **Shared Reality:** Analysis is generated at the edge but deduplicated via the "First-to-File" protocol.
5.  **Sovereign Delivery:** We do not ask permission to speak. If APIs are blocked, we automate the delivery via headless browsers.
6.  **Strict Discipline:** Modularization (350 LOC hard cap) and Testing (100% coverage) are non-negotiable.

-----

## 2. The 4-Layer Architecture

### Layer 0: Physics (The Root)

  * **Role:** Hardware Root of Trust.
  * **Tech:** Secure Enclave (iOS), StrongBox (Android), TPM (Desktop).
  * **Function:** Generates non-exportable keys. Attests to device integrity (AppAttest/Play Integrity). This layer prevents emulation and virtual machine attacks.

### Layer 1: Identity (LUMA - The Synapse)

  * **Role:** Sybil resistance, Data Sync, & Recovery.
  * **Tech:** Rust (Core), GUN (Sync Mesh), Pedersen Commitments, ZK-SNARKs.
  * **Function:**
      * **Bio-Tethering:** Liveness checks via TEE-signed biometrics.
      * **ZK-Residency:** Proof of constituency without doxxing.
      * **Recovery:** Multi-device linking and Social Recovery (M-of-N guardian signatures) to mitigate device loss.

### Layer 2: Economics (GWC - The Ledger)

  * **Role:** Value Transfer & Governance.
  * **Tech:** EVM (Layer 2 Rollup), Circom (ZK Circuits), MACI.
  * **Function:**
      * **RVU:** Real Value Unit (floating purchasing power mirror; not a peg).
      * **UBE:** Universal Basic Equity distribution.
      * **Holographic Oracle:** Medianized price feeds from Staked Nodes.
      * **Governance:** Anti-collusion voting via MACI.

### Layer 3: Application (VENN - The Interface)

  * **Role:** User Interaction, Communication, Civic Action.
  * **Tech:** React, Tauri/Capacitor, WebLLM (Edge AI), `@venn-hermes/*`.
  * **Function:** Canonical News Analysis, E2EE Messaging, Sovereign Legislative Bridge.

-----

## 3. Unified Tech Stack & Repositories

The system functions as a Monorepo with polyglot micro-services.

### 3.1 Client-Side (The "Super App")

  * **Shell:** Tauri (Desktop), Capacitor (Mobile).
  * **UI Framework:** React 18 + Vite (TypeScript).
  * **State/Sync:**
      * *Transient:* Zustand.
      * *Durable:* `@venn-hermes/gun-client` (Strictly isolated GUN wrapper).
  * **Edge AI:** **WebLLM (WASM)** running local inference (Llama-3-8B-Quantized or similar).
  * **Automation:** Playwright (bundled in Desktop) for Sovereign Delivery.

### 3.2 Server-Side (The Untrusted Cloud)

  * **Network:** P2P Mesh via Encrypted WebSockets.
  * **Relays:** Node.js 20 (Stateless). Users are incentivized to run **Home Guardian Nodes** (Raspberry Pi/Mini PC) to decentralize storage and compute.
  * **Storage:** MinIO (S3 Compatible) for encrypted blobs > 100KB.
  * **Chain:** Hardhat/Foundry for EVM contracts.

### 3.3 Engineering Constraints

  * **LOC Caps:** Soft: 250 / Hard: 350 lines per file. (Exempt: Tests, Types, ABI bindings).
  * **Test Coverage:** 100% Line/Branch coverage required.
  * **Browser Discipline:** No Node.js APIs (`fs`, `crypto`) in Client code.

-----

## 4. Core Modules & Implementation Details

### 4.1 LUMA: Bio-Tethering & Recovery

  * **Purpose:** Prevent "Account Renting" and mitigate device loss.
  * **Mechanism:**
    1.  **Session Start:** VIO (Visual Inertial Odometry) scan signed by TEE.
    2.  **Challenge:** Random micro-gesture (e.g., "Tilt left 15°") to prove liveness.
    3.  **Recovery:** Users designate Guardians or secondary devices. Restoring an identity requires `M-of-N` signatures to rotate the underlying Enclave Key without losing the Identity Nullifier.

#### 4.1.5 Identity, Trust & Constituency Model

We unify identity across LUMA, GWC, and VENN using three primitives:

* **TrustScore (0–1):** Device/session trust derived from hardware attestation. On-chain representation: integer 0–10000 (`scaled = Math.round(trustScore * 10000)`, using `TRUST_SCORE_SCALE`). Thresholds (v0): 0.5 for session/UBE/Faucet, 0.7 for QF.
* **UniquenessNullifier:** Stable per-human key. Off-chain: string. On-chain: `bytes32` hash. Shared across PWA identity, `SentimentSignal.constituency_proof.nullifier`, Region proofs, and UBE/QF attestation.
* **ConstituencyProof:** Derived from a RegionProof SNARK. Public signals: `[district_hash, nullifier, merkle_root]`. Used to attribute civic signals to a district without exposing raw region codes.

Invariants: same human → same nullifier across all layers; scaled trustScore = `Math.round(trustScore * 10000)`. See `docs/spec-identity-trust-constituency.md` for the canonical contract.

### 4.2 GWC: The Holographic Oracle

  * **Purpose:** Uncensorable pricing for the RVU.
  * **Mechanism:**
    1.  **Nodes:** 50+ Staked Economic Nodes.
    2.  **Privacy:** Price vectors encrypted via Pedersen Commitments.
    3.  **Calc:** Smart Contract calculates the **Median** homomorphically.
    4.  **Security:** No single node's specific feed is ever decrypted.

### 4.3 VENN: The Canonical Bias Engine

  * **Purpose:** Shared Analysis without Centralization.
  * **Mechanism ("First-to-File"):**
    1.  **Lookup:** User opens URL. App queries Mesh for hash of URL.
    2.  **Scenario A (Exists):** User downloads shared Analysis. WebLLM (Local) audits it. If valid, User votes.
    3.  **Scenario B (New):** **WebLLM (Local)** generates Analysis. User signs and publishes it as the **Canonical Record**.
  * **Canonical Record:** For each `urlHash`, at most one `CanonicalAnalysis` (schemaVersion `canonical-analysis-v1`) is stored and reused. Civic signals (votes, decay, messaging threads) key off the canonical `urlHash` and immutable timestamp. See `docs/canonical-analysis-v1.md`.
  * **Immutability:** CanonicalAnalysis objects are append-only in v1. Corrections or disputes are modeled as separate signals or future schema versions; they are not edited in place.
  * **Civic Decay (Asymptotic):**
          * Formula: $E_{new} = E_{current} + 0.3 * (2.0 - E_{current})$.
          * Logic: Engagement asymptotically approaches 2.0 to prevent brigading while rewarding depth.

#### 4.3.1 Civic Signals (Eye, Lightbulb, Sentiment)

For each canonical article (topic):

* **Eye (👁 Read Interest):**
  * For each `topic_id` and user, track a per-topic read score `eye_weight ∈ [0, 2]` updated via Civic Decay on each full read/expand.
  * The Eye metric displayed for a topic is an aggregate over all users’ `eye_weight` (e.g., sum or average) and may optionally show raw unique reader counts (`eye_weight > 0`).
  * Repeated reads contribute with diminishing returns and can never exceed 2 units of read interest.
* **Lightbulb (💡 Engagement Weight):**
  * Per-user-per-topic engagement weight `weight ∈ [0, 2]`, driven by engagement interactions (table stances, feedback) and independent from Eye read score; repeated reads alone do not change Lightbulb.
  * Updated via Civic Decay on each meaningful interaction:
    * Formula: `E_new = E_current + 0.3 * (2.0 - E_current)`.
    * Monotonic, asymptotically approaches 2.0, never exceeds it.
  * Aggregate Lightbulb per topic is a function of all user weights (e.g., sum or average) stored in `AggregateSentiment`.
* **Per-point Sentiment:**
  * For each `(topic_id, point_id)` (bias or counterpoint), each user has `agreement ∈ {-1, 0, +1}` representing Disagree / Neutral / Agree.
  * For aggregation, only committed votes are counted (`+1` or `-1`); neutral (`0`) is tracked per user but does not contribute to per-cell ratios.
  * Changes in `agreement` plus the user’s current Lightbulb `weight` are emitted as `SentimentSignal` events.

Civic Decay is applied per-user-per-topic. Reads (expanding an analysis) advance the user’s `eye_weight`; engagement interactions (stance changes, feedback) advance the user’s Lightbulb `weight`, each step using `E_new = E_current + 0.3 * (2.0 - E_current)` toward a 2.0 ceiling. This ensures diminishing returns on repeat interactions while rewarding sustained engagement.

### 4.4 HERMES: The Sovereign Legislative Bridge

  * **Purpose:** Verified influence that cannot be blocked.
  * **Mechanism:**
    1.  **Aggregate:** Nodes collect proposals via HRW hashing.
    2.  **Verify:** LUMA attaches **ZK-Proof of Constituency**.
    3.  **Deliver (Sovereign Fallback):**
          * **Desktop:** Local Playwright instance fills the `.gov` form.
          * **Mobile:** Delegate delivery to **Home Guardian Node** (Trusted Relay). The Node fills the form using the user's signed payload.

## 6. Data Models

### 6.1 The "Proof of Human" Session

```json
{
  "type": "GWC_BioTethered_Session",
  "version": "3.1",
  "device_id": "DEVICE_PUBKEY_HASH",
  "timestamp": 1699982735,
  "trustScore": 0.95,
  "client_integrity": { "app_attestation": "Apple_AppAttest_v1" },
  "proof": {
    "uniqueness_nullifier": "nullifier-abc123...",
    "vio_integrity_score": 0.99,
    "tee_signature": "BASE64_SIGNED_BLOB"
  }
}
```

AttestationVerifier derives a stable nullifier from device- or LUMA-bound keys and issues a per-session token. The nullifier is the canonical human key shared with GWC contracts (via UBE/QF attestation) and VENN civic signals; session tokens are per-session.

### 6.2 The Civic Sentiment Signal

We distinguish between event-level signals and aggregate sentiment.

```typescript
// Event-level: one user, one point, one interaction
interface SentimentSignal {
  topic_id: string;       // Hash of Canonical URL
  analysis_id: string;    // Hash of the Canonical Analysis Object
  point_id: string;       // ID of the bias/counterpoint/perspective
  agreement: 1 | 0 | -1;  // 3-state Agree / None / Disagree
  weight: number;         // User’s per-topic Lightbulb from engagement, in [0, 2]

  constituency_proof: {
      district_hash: string; 
      nullifier: string;
      merkle_root: string;
  };

  emitted_at: number;     // Unix timestamp
}

interface PointStats {
  agree: number;    // distinct users with final agreement = +1
  disagree: number; // distinct users with final agreement = -1
}

// Aggregate-level: mesh / ledger projection
interface AggregateSentiment {
  topic_id: string;
  analysis_id: string;

  // Per point: committed votes only (neutral not counted)
  point_stats: Record<string, PointStats>;

  // Optional convenience: derived dominant stance per point based on point_stats
  bias_vector: Record<string, 1 | 0 | -1>;

  // Global engagement signal (function of all user Lightbulb weights, e.g. sum or average)
  weight: number;          // Aggregate Lightbulb
  engagementScore: number; // Additional metric if needed (e.g. entropy, variance)
}
```

Invariants:

* For any SentimentSignal, `0 ≤ weight ≤ 2`.
* For any topic and user, Lightbulb `weight` is updated only via the Civic Decay function on engagement interactions.
* Per-point aggregates ignore neutral (`0`) when computing `point_stats`; `bias_vector` is derived from `point_stats` (e.g., sign of `agree - disagree`).
* `AggregateSentiment` is a deterministic function of the stream of SentimentSignal events.
* `constituency_proof` MUST be derived from a valid RegionProof: `district_hash = publicSignals[0]`, `nullifier = publicSignals[1]` (same UniquenessNullifier as identity), `merkle_root = publicSignals[2]`.

See `docs/spec-civic-sentiment.md` for the normative contract across client, mesh, and chain.

### 6.3 Canonical Analysis (v1)

Canonical Analysis is the canonical record of "what this URL means in VENN-world."

**Schema (`canonical-analysis-v1`):**

```typescript
type BiasEntry = {
  bias: string;        // Debate-style claim capturing article’s slant
  quote: string;       // Direct quote from the article supporting the claim
  explanation: string; // Why this quote evidences the bias (short, academic)
  counterpoint: string;// Direct rebuttal / alternative framing
};

interface CanonicalAnalysisV1 {
  schemaVersion: 'canonical-analysis-v1';
  url: string;
  urlHash: string; // Stable hash of normalized URL
  summary: string; // 4–6 sentence neutral summary
  bias_claim_quote: string[];
  justify_bias_claim: string[];
  biases: string[];
  counterpoints: string[];
  perspectives?: Array<{ frame: string; reframe: string }>;
  sentimentScore: number; // [-1, 1] overall slant
  confidence?: number;    // [0, 1] model self-confidence
  timestamp: number;      // ms since epoch (first write)
}
```

**Invariants**

1. `bias_claim_quote.length === justify_bias_claim.length === biases.length === counterpoints.length`.
2. Summary and all arrays are derived only from the article text (**fact-only rule**).
3. `schemaVersion` is required and immutable once written.

**Fact-only rule**

Summaries and bias tables MUST NOT introduce information absent from the source article (no new entities, dates, locations, quantities, or motives).

**First-to-file semantics (v1)**

* Canonical analysis is keyed by `urlHash`.
* The first successfully validated analysis for a `urlHash` is reused; later writes cannot overwrite it in v1.
* Corrections/disagreements are separate signals (votes, sentiment, replies), not mutations of the canonical object.
* Future versions (e.g., `canonical-analysis-v2`) may introduce explicit amendment/supersession; v1 treats the record as append-only.

URLs are normalized upstream; the canonical schema enforces `url` as a valid URL (Zod `.url()`), and hashing always uses the normalized form.

See `docs/canonical-analysis-v1.md` for the precise wire-format contract and validation rules.
